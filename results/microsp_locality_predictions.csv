2,Acarispora falculifera,"Ultrastructural characterization of Acarispora falculifera n.gen., n.sp., a new microsporidium (Opisthokonta: Chytridiopsida) from the feather mite Falculifer rostratus (Astigmata: Pterolichoidea) ::: Only about 20 species of microsporidia have been described from mites. All except one species produce typical spores with a long polar filament and a polaroplast. This paper is the first study of an atypical microsporidium infection in a feather mite (Falculifer rostratus). The infection of the pigeon feather mite is restricted to the colon epithelium where it leads to hypertrophy of the concerned cells. During sporogony, a multinucleate plasmodial aggregate is formed within a sporont (endogenous sporogony resulting in a polysporophorous vesicle). The cisterns delimiting the single sporoblasts later form the spore walls. Sporogonial stages are in direct contact to the host cell cytoplasm. Merogonial stages were not present. Spores are tiny (3.6 μm × 2.6 μm), broad oval in form and monokaryotic. The spore wall of mature spores consists of a three-layered endospore and a thin, electron-dense, wavy exospore. The polar filament is anisofilar and completely coiled in 3–4 turns. In cross-sections, it has a star-like appearance because the electron-dense core forms rounded compartments of lucent material at its surface. In superficial sections, this results in a honeycomb-like pattern. A polaroplast is missing. The polar filament arises subapically at a polar sac that lacks an internal anchoring disk. These atypical spore structures clearly classify the species from the feather mite as a member of the order Chytridiopsida. It could not be clearly affiliated to one of the known genera, so we created a new genus, Acarispora, with the species A. Falculifera.",Germany (Near Greifswald),Germany (Near Greifswald),
3,Agglomerata cladocera (siberian isolate),"Microsporidia Alfvenia sibirica sp. n. and Agglomerata cladocera (Pfeiffer) 1895, from Siberian microcrustaceans and phylogenetic relationships within the “Aquatic outgroup” lineage of fresh water microsporidia ::: Here we report on two microsporidia from freshwater crustaceans collected during the ongoing survey for microsporidia in the river Karasuk and adjacent waterbodies (Novosibirsk region, Western Siberia). The first species parasitized hypoderm and fat body of a cyclopid Cyclops sp. (Maxillopoda, Copedoda) and produced oval spores, measured 2.0×3.6μm (fixed) enclosed individually or in small groups in fragile sporophorous vesicles (SVs). We describe it here as Alfvenia sibirica sp. n. The second species infected the same tissues of a cladoceran Daphnia magna (Branchiopoda, Phyllopoda). Its spores were pyriform, 2.3×4.0μm (fixed), and resided in relatively persistent SVs in groups of 8–16. This species was identified as a Siberian isolate (Si) of Agglomerata cladocera (Pfeifer) because ultrastructurally it was hardly distinguishable from A. cladocera recorded from England from the same host (Larsson et al., 1996). A. cladocera (Si) shared 99% SSU rDNA sequence similarity to Binucleata daphniae from D. magna collected in Belgium (Refardt et al., 2008). The major outcome of our work is that we present molecular (SSUrDNA) characterization coupled with EM description, for representatives of two genera, Alfvenia (encompasses 3 described so far species) and Agglomerata (7 species), which allowed us to place these two genera on the phylogenetic tree. We also summarized the literature data on Alfvenia and Agglomerata spp., and provided their comparative morphological analysis. These two genera belong to so called “Aquatic outgroup” (Vossbrinck et al., 2004), a poorly resolved lineage, a sister to Amblyosporidae. This lineage probably includes majority of fresh water forms of microsporidia, most of which remain undescribed. SSUrDNA-based phylogenetic analysis and analysis of hosts suggest that diversification within the “Aquatic outgroup” could have been connected with the host switch from dipterans or copepods to cladocerans that had occurred in some ancestral Amblyospora-related lineage(s).",(Novosibirsk region) Western Siberia,Siberia (Novosibirsk region),Belgium (); Russia (Novosibirsk); Australia (Siberia); United Kingdom (England)
4,Agglomerata connexa,"Ultrastructural study of Agglomerata connexa sp. nov. (Microspora, Duboscqiidae), a new microsporidian parasite of Daphnia longispina (Cladocera, Daphniidae) ::: The new microsporidium, Agglomerata connexa sp. nov., is described, based primarily on ultrastructural characteristies. The parasite infeets the adipose tissue of Daphnia longispina O.F. Müller, 1785. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Sporogonial reproduction is by rosette- or finger-like budding. Sporophorous vesicles contain not more than 4 mature spores, most vesicles are monosporous, and usually devoid of inclusions. Rare aggregates of tubules are visible inside multisporaus and outside of individual sporophorous vesicles. Often two or moreindividual vesieles form a chain-like strueture. Unfixed spores are pyriform, measuring 4.08 ± 0.27 x 2.72 ± 0.24 um. The exospore is layered, approximately 30 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar, 140 nm wide, making 5-7 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has three subdivisions: wide lamellae, narrow lamellae and tubules. Diserimination from other microsporidian species is discussed.",Poland,Poland (),
5,Agglomerata daphnia,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new species, Agglomerata daphniae n. sp. from the hypoderm of Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Daphniidae) ::: A new microsporidian species was described from the hypoderm of Daphnia magna sampled from gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) ponds located in Wuhan city, China. The infected cladocerans generally appeared opaque due to numerous plasmodia distributed in the host integument. The earliest stages observed were uninucleate meronts that were in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Meronts developed into multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia enclosed in sporophorous vesicles. Sporoblasts were produced by the rosette-like division of sporogonial division. Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 4.48 ± 0.09 (4.34-4.65) µm long and 2.40 ± 0.08 (2.18-2.54) µm wide. The polaroplast was bipartite with loose anterior lamellae and tight posterior lamellae. Polar filaments, arranged in two rows, were anisofilar with two wider anterior coils, and five narrower posterior coils. The exospore was covered with fibrous secretions and was composed of four layers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the obtained SSU rDNA sequence, indicated that the present species clustered with three unidentified Daphnia pulicaria-infecting microsporidia with high support values to form a monophyletic lineage, rather than with the congener, Agglomerata cladocera. The barcode motif of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the novel species was unique among representatives of the ""Agglomeratidae"" sensu clade (Vávra et al., 2018). Based on the morphological characters and SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, a new species was erected and named as Agglomerata daphniae n. sp. This is the first report of zooplankton-infecting microsporidia in China.",China (Wuhan),China (Wuhan),China (Hanyang)
6,Agglomerata lacrima,"Ultrastructure and light microscopic cytology of Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. (Microspora, Duboscqiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Acanthocyclops vernalis (Copepoda, Cyclopidae) ::: Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. is the first species of the genus described from a copepod host (Acanthocyclops vernalis.) It was studied using light- and electron-microscopy. All stages of the life-cycle had isolated nuclei. The earliest stages found were uninucleate merozoites. Sporogony produced 4-12 (mostly 8) pyriform spores by rosette-like budding within a fragile sporophorous vesicle. Live spores measured 4.4 +/- 0.2 x 2.6 +/- 0.2 μm, and fixed spores measured 3.7 +/- 0.2 x 1.6 +/- 0.2 μm. The exospore was constructed of 4 layers. The anisofilar polar filament made 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast had an anterior part with wide lamellae (chambers), followed by a second zone of narrow lamellae. Tubule-like structures which might constitute a third polaroplast region were present immediately anterior to the first filament coil. Cytological characteristics and the generic position of the species are discussed, and it is compared to related or resembling species, and to all previously reported microsporidian species from copepods.",Sweden,Sweden (),
7,Agglomerata volgensae,"Light and electron microscopic study of Agglomerata volgensae n. sp. (Microspora: Dubosqiidae), a new microsporidian parasite of Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Daphniidae) ::: The new microsporidium Agglomerata volgensae n. sp. is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. The parasite invades the hypoderm and adipose tissue of Daphnia magna and causes hypertrophy. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Sporogonial plasmodia divide by rosette-like division, producing 4-16, usually 8, sporoblasts. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated after the first nuclear division of the sporont. The fragile vesicle either collects all daughter cells of the sporont, or the vesicle divides together with the plasmodium to enclose spores in individual sporophorous vesicles. Fibril-like projections connect the exospore with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Tubules, with walls of exospore material, are formed together with the sporoblasts. Mature spores are pyriform with pointed anterior pole and an obliquely positioned posterior vacuole. Unfixed spores measure 3.2-3.7x1.7-2.0 μm. The exospore is layered, approximately 38 nm thick. The polar filament is lightly anisofilar with 2-3 wide anterior coils, and 2-3 more narrow posterior coils, in a single layer of coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has two regions: irregular wide lamellae or chambers surrounding the straight part of the filament, and more loosely arranged narrow lamellae in the coil region. The discrimination from other microsporidian species and the systematic position are briefly discussed.",Russia,Russia (),

Xenomas occur either singly in the lamina propria of the intestine, or aggregated into cystic bodies of up to 0.2 mm diameter, which emerge above the intestine surface. The xenoma is bounded by a folded plasmalemma with pinocytotic depressions, and there is a central, enlarged nucleus. Plasmodial stages and elongate meronts differentiate ~ n t o ribbon-shaped sporonts and single-nucleated sporo- blasts. The spore cytoplasm is invaginated at the posterior end.

The microsporidium is monomorphic, monoxenic, and develops in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The infection first appears with thoracic muscles, followed by a generalized invasion of the host. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. Mature spores are ovoid. Unfixed spores measure 3.7–4.2 × 2.0–2.6 μm, fixed and stained spores 3.5–5.0 × 2.4–2.8 μm. The polaroplast consists of dense lamellae and rare lamellae. The polar tube is slightly anisofilar, consisting of 11–17 coils, with 9–14 proximal (130 nm in diameter) and 2–3 distal coils (120 nm in diameter) arranged in one layer. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based upon a short portion of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Genbank accession # KP455651) placed the new microsporidium within Liebermannia-Orthosomella lineage, which contains multiple undescribed parasites. In particular, A. bostrichidis showed maximal sequence similarity of 95% to Microsporidium sp.

13,Amazonspora hassar,"Amazonspora hassar n. gen. and n. sp. (Phylum Microsporidia, fam. Glugeidae), a parasite of the Amazonian teleost Hassar orestis (fam. Doradidae) ::: We describe the microsporidian Amazonspora hassar n. gen., n. sp. from the gill xenomas of the teleost Hassar orestis (Doradidae) collected in the estuarine region of the Amazon River. The parasite appeared as a small whitish xenoma located in the gill filaments near the blood vessels. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic host cell (HHC) in the cytoplasm of which the microsporidian developed and proliferated. The xenoma wall was composed of up to approximately 22 juxtaposed crossed layers of collagen fibers. The plasmalemma of the HHC presented numerous anastomosed, microvilli-like structures projecting outward through the 1-3 first internal layers of the collagen fibrils. The parasite was in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm in all stages of the cycle (merogony and sporogony). Sporogony appears to divide by plasmotomy, giving rise to 4 uninucleate sporoblasts, which develop into uninucleate spores. The ellipsoidal spores measured 2.69 ± 0.45 × 1.78 ± 0.18 μm, and the wall measured ∼75 nm. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, being shifted laterally from the anterior pole. The polar filament was arranged into 7-8 coils in a single layer in the posterior half of the spore, surrounding the posterior vacuole. The polaroplast surrounded the uncoiled portion of the polar filament, and it was exclusively lamellar. The spores and different life-cycle stages were intermingled within the cytoplasm of the HHC, surrounding the central hypertrophic deeply branched nucleus.

Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool near the village of Bakchar, Tomsk region, Western Siberia) Russia",Russia (pool near the village of Bakchar | Tomsk region | Siberia),Russia (Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk | Siberia)

Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool in Tomsk region, Western Siberia) Russia",Russia (pool in Tomsk region | Siberia),Russia (Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk | Siberia)

Meiospores of A. camposi (5.8 x 4.1 μm) were infectious per os to female adults of the copepod P. f. fimbriatus. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei, with sporulation involving the formation of a sub-persistent, sporontogenic, interfacial envelope and the production of a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of P. f. fimbriatus, were large, pyriform, and measured 10.70 x 3.85 μm. When ingested they infected C. renatoi larvae to initiate a sequence that involves schizogony and gametogony and ends with plasmogamy and nuclear association to form diplokaryotic meronts. Oblong ovate binucleate spores (7.86 x 2.96 μm) are formed in the adult mosquito and are responsible for vertical transmission to the filial generation.

37,Amblyospora egypti,"A light- and electron-microscopic study of Amblyospora egypti n.sp. infecting Culex pipiens in Egypt ::: A microsporidium was found infecting the fat body of larvae and adults of both sexes of Culex pipiens in Egypt. Developmental stages were found in larvae but only masses of spores were present in adults. The infection was easily visible in live mosquito larvae, as one or two blocks of opaque whitish fat body visible through the cuticle in each segment. Meronts were rounded cells, which were bounded by an unthickened unit membrane and divided by binary fission (rarely into four). At the onset of sporogony the surface membrane was thickened by electron dense deposits. This coat was sloughed off to form the sporophorous vesicle, the separation from the sporont surface being effected by the secretion of metabolic products into the sporophorous vesicle cavity. Division within the vesicle gave rise to eight uninucleate sporoblasts, then uninucleate spores. Spores exhibited an exospore of two membrane-like layers and a subtending layer of moderate electron density, appearing as eight to ten strata separated by fine lines and permeated by amorphous material, and an electron lucent endospore. The polar tube was anisofilar with 3–4 broad coils and 4–3 narrow coils.

In fat body cells, these sporonts secrete pansporoblastic membranes and undergo two nuclear divisions to form octonucleate sporonts.

Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool located near the village of Timirjasevo, Tomsk region, Western Siberia) Russia",Russia (pool located near the village of Timirjasevo | Tomsk region | Siberia),Russia (Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk | Siberia)

(Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae), Parasite of Culex salinarius (Diptera: Culicidae): Its Life Cycle Stages in an Intermediate Host ::: Horizontal transmission testing with an Amblyospora species from the mosquito Culex salinarius has documented the involvement of a copepod intermediate host. Meiospores (one type of uninucleate spore) of the Amblyospora sp. were infectious per os to female Macrocyclops albidus adults. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei (were haplophasic), starting with the sporoplasms from the meiospore, continuing as a succession of schizonts undergoing binary division and ending with sporulation, producing a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of M. albidus,were lanceolate, slightly curved and measured 13.23 × 3.85 μm. They infected C. salinarius larvae, both male and female, when ingested. In addition, cross-infectivity testing was conducted and demonstrated that while A. californica from C. tarsalis will infect C. salinarius,it does not complete its life cycle in this host. Based on these findings, we conclude that Amblyospora sp. from Culex salinariusis a distinct species and assign it the name Amblyospora salinarian. Sp",U.S.A.

Diplokaryotic meronts, which divided by binary fission, were distinguished at the electron microscope level by their unthickened plasma membranes. Sporonts with an electron-dense surface coat gave rise to eight uninucleate sporoblasts within a sporophorous vesicle, cytoplasmic division occurring at the quadrinucleate or octonucleate stages. Indications that nuclear fusion and chromosome reorganization occurred in merogony and sporogony were obtained by light microscopy but meiosis was not detected at the ultrastructural level. Spores were typical of Amblyospora, being ovoid when fresh, truncate when stained, and having an exospore of two membranous layers subtended by a thick amorphous layer, an electron-lucent endospore, an anisofilar polar filament, and a polaroplast comprised of an anterior region of close-packed lamellae and a posterior region of expanded sacs. The metabolic products in the sporophorous vesicle took the form of large globules, small globules with electron-dense borders, and fine granules. These were depleted in mature sporophorous vesicles, though a surface layer of fine granules on the spores may have been derived from them. Many stages were degenerate and it is suggested that C. pipiens may be an accidental host in which the parasite could develop suboptimally in nervous tissue only.

84,Ameson herrnkindi,"Characterization of microsporidian Ameson herrnkindi sp. nov. infecting Caribbean spiny lobsters Panulirus argus ::: The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus supports a large and valuable fishery in the Caribbean Sea. In 2007-2008, a rare microsporidian parasite with spore characteristics typical of the Ameson genus was detected in 2 spiny lobsters from southeast Florida (FL). However, the parasite species was not confirmed by molecular analyses. To address this deficiency, reported here are structural and molecular data on single lobsters displaying comparable ‘cotton-like’ abdominal muscle containing ovoid microsporidian spores found at different locations in FL in 2014 and 2018 and in Saint Kitts and Nevis Islands in 2017. In the lobster from 2014, multiple life stages consistent with an Ameson-like monokaryotic microsporidian were detected by transmission electron microscopy. A partial (1228 bp) small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequence showed each microsporidia to be identical and positioned it closest phylogenetically to Ameson pulvis in a highly supported clade also containing A. michaelis, A. metacarcini, A. portunus, and Nadelspora canceri.

(Microsporidia) infecting the muscles of Dungeness crabs Metacarcinus magister from British Columbia, Canada ::: The Dungeness crab Metacarcinus magister supports a large and valuable fishery along the west coast of North America. Since 1998, Dungeness crabs exhibiting pink- to orange-colored joints and opaque white musculature have been sporadically observed in low prevalence from the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada. We provide histological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence that this condition is caused by a new microsporidian parasite. Crabs displaying gross symptoms were confirmed to have heavy infections of ovoid-shaped microsporidian spores (~1.8 × 1.4 µm in size) within muscle bundles of the skeletal musculature. The parasite apparently infected the outer periphery of each muscle bundle, and then proliferated into the muscle fibres near the centre of each infected bundle. Light infections were observed in heart tissues, and occasionally spores were observed within the fixed phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple life stages of a monokaryotic microsporidian parasite within the sarcoplasm of muscle fibres. Molecular analysis of partial small subunit rRNA sequence data from the new species revealed an affinity to Ameson, a genus of Microsporidia infecting marine crustaceans. Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species is distinct from Nadelspora canceri, a related microsporidian that also infects the muscles of this host. At present, little is known about the distribution, seasonality, and transmission of A. metacarcini in M. magister.",(British Columbia) Canada,Canada (British Columbia),Canada (British Columbia); North America (); Australia (Fraser River)

88,Andreanna caspii,"Molecular and ultrastructural characterization of Andreanna caspii n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae), a parasite of Ochlerotatus caspius (Diptera: Culicidae) ::: Abstract A new genus and species of microsporidia, Andreanna caspii n. gen., n. sp. is described from the mosquito, Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas) based on ultrastructural morphology, developmental characteristics, and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Parasite development is confined to fat body tissue and infected larvae appear swollen with dull white masses within the thorax and abdomen. Meronts have diplokaryotic nuclei and are delineated by a simple plasmalemma contiguous with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony occurs by synchronous binary division followed by cytokinesis. Diplokaryotic sporonts undergo meiosis and synchronous nuclear division forming sporogonial plasmodia with two, four and eight nuclei enclosed within a persistent sporophorous vesicle. Cytokinesis of sporogonial plasmodia results in the formation of eight uninucleate spores. The episporontal space of early sporonts is filled with a homogeneous accumulation of electron dense granular inclusions and ovoid vesicles of various dimensions, transforming into an interwoven matrix during the initial phase of sporogenesis. Spores are oval, uninucleate and measure 4.8±0.3×3.1±0.4μm (fixed). The spore wall is 260μm thick with an irregular exospore consisting of two layers (150–170μm) and a thinner endospore (90–100μm). The anchoring disk is well developed and is contiguous with a lamellar polaroplast that occupies the anterior third of the spore and possess more narrow lamellae on the posterior end. The polar filament is gradually tapered and arranged in a single row consisting of six coils ranging from 180 to 150μm in diameter. The posterior vacuole (posterosome) is moderately sized and filled with a matrix of moderate electron density. Phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA from A. caspii and 30 other species of microsporidia including 11 genera parasitic in mosquitoes using maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods showed A. caspii to be a sister group to the clade containing all of the Amblyospora species, including Culicospora, Edhazardia and Intrapredatorus, as well as Culicosporella and Hyalinocysta thus providing strong support for establishment of Andreanna as a separate genus.",Siberia,Siberia (),150μm ()

Sporogony and spore ultrastructure of this microsporidium differed from that of known microsporidian species, suggesting establishment of a new species, Anisofilariata chironomi, being a type species of a new genus. Sporogony di-, tetra-, octo-, and 16-sporoblastic. Fixed and stained spores are 4.7-6.8 x 3.4-5.4 microm in size, the spore measurements varying depending upon the number of spores in the sporophorous vesicle. The polaroplast is bipartite, with anterior and posterior parts composed of very thin and thick lamellae, respectively, and occupies the major volume of the spore. The polar filament is anisofilar, with two broad proximal and 10-13 narrow distal coils arranged in 2-4 layers. The sporophorous vesicle is bounded by a thin membrane and contains multiple tubular structures.

(Microsporidia) Infecting Niphargogammarus intermedius (Crustacea, Amphipoda) from the Azov Sea ::: Abstract Five out of one hundred adults of Niphargogammarus intermedius caught at the Azov sea shore were found to be infected with microsporidia. The infection was found in the subcuticular fat body and myocytes. Parasites developed in direct contact with host cells, displayed a disporoblastic sporogony and diplokaryotic arrangement of nuclei at all stages. Spores were oval, 4.6–5.8 × 2.6–3.0 μm. Exospore appendages, vesicular–tubular secretions, and the anisofilar polar filament indicated a similarity to Anncaliia species. Sporont surfaces displayed ridges of amorphous material. Meronts and sporonts formed protoplastic extensions, similar to A. vesicularum and A. meligheti. Mature spores possessed a bipartite polaroplast. The polar tube was arranged in one row of 13–18 coils including 0–3 distal coils of lesser diameter. Partial sequencing of SSU, ITS, and LSU regions of rRNA gene (GenBank accessions: KY288064–KY288065) confirmed this new species to be congeneric with A. algerae (#AF069063) and A. meligheti (#AY894423). The SSU gene of this novel microsporidium shared 99.4% sequence similarity to A. algerae and 98.9% to A. meligheti. Genes for HSP70 and RPB1 amplified with primers designed for A. algerae orthologs displayed 99.7% and 97.4% similarity, respectively, between A. algerae and the novel microsporidium.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations. Hence, this study illustrates the usefulness of molecular approaches to study prevalent, but cryptic, infections involving microsporidian parasites of gut tissues.",Southern France; Ukraine,Ukraine (); Corte Franca (),France ()
94,Antonospora psocopterae,"New microsporidia parasitizing bark lice (Insecta: Psocoptera) ::: Abstract Two species of bark lice, Xanthocaecilius sommermanae Mockford and Polypsocus corruptus Hagen, collected in a canopy Malaise trap placed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park as part of a survey of the park’s fauna, were found to be infected with microsporidia. Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data.

(Protozoa, microsporidia) a parasite of the communal bee, Andrena scotica Perkins, 1916 (Hymenoptera, andrenidae) ::: The new microsporidium Antonospora scoticae n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of the communal bee Andrena scotica, is described based on light microscopy, ultrastructural characteristics and the nucleotide sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA coding region. The parasite is apansporoblastic and develops in close contact with the host cytoplasm. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Cytoplasmic fission was not observed, but the sporogony is believed to be disporoblastic. Live spores are ovocylindrical, straight to slightly curved, and measure 6.8 x 2.7 μm whereas spores fixed and stained for TEM measure 5.0 x 1.8 υm. The exospore is four-layered, with an internal single layer followed by a thicker, more electron dense layer, then another single layer followed by a thin external double layer. The polar filament is isofilar and arranged in 15-22 coils in the posterior and mid-part of the spore. The polaroplast has tightly packed lamellae that become less densely packed in the posterior region. The coding region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA is 1371 base pairs long. Its GC content (62%) is significantly higher than previously reported for this group of organisms. The systematic position of the described microsporidium was found to be ambiguous and is discussed in the context of inconsistencies between the molecular and morphological taxonomy of microsporidia. A new genus is proposed for A. scoticae without defining superior taxa because the current developmental and morphological evidence is limited and partly contradictory to the molecular data. Current taxonomies of microsporidia are based on characters that are most likely polyphyletic in nature. Traditional systems of microsporidian taxonomy may need to be extensively revised, as molecular data become available.",Sweden (Oland),Sweden (Öland),

A milky-white shrimp was found in the Mobile Bay Delta, a large, oligohaline-freshwater wetland in Alabama, USA. Light microscopy of smears and thick sections of the abdominal tissues demonstrated infection with microsporidian spores enclosed in sporophorous vesicles (SVs) in sets of eight. Broadly oval spores measured 2.9 ± 0.06 × 1.7 ± 0.03 µm (2.5–3.3 × 1.6–1.9 µm, n = 11). SVs with a persistent membrane ranged from 4.4 to 5.6 µm in diameter. Subcuticular epithelium and underlying musculature were packed with sporonts, sporoblasts, and spores. Electron microscopy demonstrated diplokaryotic meronts that gave rise to sporont mother cells with a large single nucleus. The meront plasma membrane turned into a SV envelope, and the sporont wall segregated internally. The sporont nucleus underwent meiosis followed by two mitotic divisions accompanied by internal budding to produce four sporonts, each dividing in two uninucleate sporoblasts. Eight-spore SVs were filled with fibrillary-tubular secretions. Spores possessed 90–110-nm thick envelopes (exospore, 40–60 nm + endospore, 30–50 nm), a triangle-shaped nucleus, isofilar polar filament of 10–13 coils arranged in two-three rows, bipartite polaroplast, and a mushroom-shaped polar disk. The SSU rDNA sequence of the novel species was deposited in GenBank under Accession number MG 708238. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Riverine grass shrimp microsporidium was a new species and placed it in one branch with two species of Potaspora, xenoma-forming microsporidia from freshwater perciform fishes. Because morphological and developmental characters of the novel species did not fit the diagnosis of the genus Potaspora, and, based on SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, different host specificity, pathogenesis, and ecological considerations, we erect here the new genus Apotaspora for the Riverine grass shrimp microsporidium and name the new species Apotaspora heleios. Grouping together fish and crustacean parasites on SSU rDNA phylogenetic trees suggests that polyxenous life cycles might be a common feature of extinct and/or extant members of the studied lineage of the Microsporidia.",(Alabama) USA,United States (Alabama),United States (Gulf Coast states | Alabama); Mobile Bay Delta (); n  ()
97,Areospora rohanae,"Areospora rohanae n.gen. n.sp.

Phylogenetic and morphological distinction from other known lineages within the phylum also provide strong support for erection of a new family (Areosporiidae n. fam) to contain the parasite. Recognised via lesions observed by workers in king crab processing facilities in southern Chile, the parasite elicits giant cell formation in infected crabs. Merogony within haemocytes and fixed phagocytes proceeds apparent fusion of infected cells to produce multinucleate syncitia in which further development of the parasite occurs. Subsequent recruitment of adjacent cells within the haemal spaces of the hepatopancreas, the podocytes of the gill, and particularly in the subcuticular connective tissues, characterises the pathogenesis of A. rohanae. In late stages of infection, significant remodelling of the subcuticular tissues corresponds to the clinical lesions observed within processing plants. Sporogony of A. rohanae also occurs within the syncitial cytoplasm and culminates in production of bizarre spores, ornamented with distinctive tubular bristles. Spores occur in sets of 8 within a sporophorous vesicle. The description of A. rohanae offers considerable insight into the pathogenesis of giant-cell forming Microsporidia, signifies a new lineage of giant-cell forming Microsporidia in marine hosts, and may reflect emergence of a commercially-significant pathogen in the southern ocean Lithodes santolla fishery.",(Straits of Magellan) Chile,Chile (Strait of Magellan),Chile ()

(Microspora, Mrazekiidae), is described from the freshwater oligochaete Nais simplex (Oligochaeta, Naididae). Initial stages of parasite development consist of a monokaryotic merogony within a haemocyte of the intestinal blood sinus. The resulting hypertrophied haemocyte is attached to the chloragocytes of the sinus by fine cytoplasmic extensions with the sinus around the cell becoming greatly enlarged. The meronts within the haemocyte form diplokaryotic sporonts that undergo sporogenesis directly within the cytoplasm of the host cell. The infected cell becomes packed with spores and developmental stages, causing it dramatically to increase in size, eventually rupturing the oligochaete and cell. Sporogony appears to be disporoblastic. Released spores were observed to have an adhesive quality. Transmission studies conducted with mature spores failed to transmit the parasite horizontally although vertical transmission was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of the parasite demonstrated that B. vesiculoformis clustered with microsporidian parasites of bryozoa and two other microsporidians, Janacekia debaiseuxi and an unidentified Bacillidium sp.",Scotland,Scotland (),

(Microspora: Amblyosporidae) was isolated from testes of a water boatman Sigara lateralis (Heteroptera: Corixidae) near Bavorov, South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The life cycle of the pathogen includes a merogony with uninucleate stages, a meiotic sequence in part with binucleate stages (diplokarya) and a sporogony resulting in a persistent sporophorous vesicle containing eight spores. Spores are long oval, slightly curved, with broader basis and equally rounded ends, 5 ± 0.5 x 2.5 ± 0.5 μm in diameter. A series ending with early spores serving for autoinfection in the primary host and spread of the infection in other tissues differs in ultrastructure of spores. They are shorter and more constricted apically and measure 4 x 2.5 ± 3 μm. Both spore types have a polaroplast with a central part with multiple broad chambers enclosed anteriorly and posteriorly in circular layers of dense lamellae. The spore wall of both types is characterized by a thin exospore and an endospore of equal thickness all over the spore with exception of the attenuated apical pole. Mature spores have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 - 11 turns with first 5 - 6 broader turns and 4 - 5 narrower turns. The early spores have the filament coiled in 7 turns, of which 4 are broader and 3 narrower. All characteristics of the new microsporidium reveal that it is similar to different Amblyosporidae and we therefore propose to include it into this family.

(Fungi: Microsporidia), a Parasite of Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) ::: ABSTRACT . We describe a new microsporidian species Binucleata daphniae, n. g., n. sp., that infects the integument cells lining the hemocoele cavity of the carapace and the postabdomen of the cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus. Infected cells filled with spores accumulate as large clusters in the carapace cavity and heavily infected hosts are detected by their opaque appearance. Despite the parasite's presence, infected Daphnia grow and molt, but have a reduced fecundity. During the parasite's life cycle, chain-like meronts with isolated nuclei are formed, giving rise to binucleate presporonts, the most frequently observed, characteristic developmental stage. In sporogony, the nuclei of the presporont separate, divide, and eight spores enclosed in a thin-walled sporophorous vesicle are formed. Spores are 4.9 × 2.5 μm in size (fresh) and have an anisofilar polar filament with eight coils. DNA sequence analysis places B. daphniae in a clade of microsporidians that parasitize crustaceans and mosquitoes and have assumed complex life cycles. Binucleata daphniae, however, has a simple and direct life cycle and can be transferred to naïve hosts and maintained as persistent infections in populations of its host D. magna. We propose that B. daphniae has simplified its life cycle by losing its secondary host, rendering it unique in this clade.",Belgium,Belgium (),

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Rounded merogonial Plasmodia produce at least 8 diplokaryotic merozoites by plasmotomy. Sporogonial Plasmodia, with 16–32 diplokarya, are initially rounded, but the shape changes to ribbon-like prior to the release of sporoblasts. The close association between the nuclei breaks at the end of the sporogony. The fragile sporophorous vesicle breaks when the spores are mature. The binucleate spores are rod-shaped, slightly curved, and measure approximately 2 × 5-6.8 μm in living condition. The exospore is two-layered with an internal double membrane-like layer and a cover of granular material. The isofilar polar filament is arranged in 11–14 irregular coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has three regions: narrow, closely packed lamellae anteriorly, wider lamellae in the median region, and posterior tubuli. The nuclei are enveloped in multiple layers of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The microsporidium is compared to the microsporidia of Ostracoda, and its possible relations to the genera Octosporea, Pseudopleistophora and Perezia are discussed. The new genus is provisionally included in the family Caudosporidae.","Sweden (Hoje a river, Esarp)",Sweden (Hoje a river | Esarp),Sweden (); Brazil (Fazenda N. Rezek)

It infects most tissues of adult male and female mosquitoes, destroying the midgut, Malpighian tubules, the fat body, muscles, hypoderm and connective tissues. It is usually transmitted with feces released by mosquitoes during feeding on cotton swabs with honey water. In sporogony the oval binucleate spores, 2.5-3 x 1.5-2 μm, have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 coils in one row. Five anterior coils are of larger diameter than the posterior three to four.

111,Brachiola vesicularum,"Brachiola vesicularum, n. g., n. sp., a new microsporidium associated with AIDS and myositis ::: Brachiola vesicularum, n. g., n. sp., is a new microsporidum associated with AIDS and myositis. Biopsied muscle tissue, examined by light and electron microscopy, revealed the presence of organisms developing in direct contact with muscle cell cytoplasm and fibers. No other tissue types were infected. All parasite stages contain diplokaryotic nuclei and all cell division is by binary fission. Sporogony is disporoblastic, producing 2.9 x 2 microns diplokaryotic spores containing 8-10 coils of the polar filament arranged in one to three rows, usually two. Additionally, this microsporidium produces electron-dense extracellular secretions and vesiculotubular appendages similar to Nosema algerae. However, the production of protoplasmic extensions which may branch and terminate in extensive vesiculotubular structures is unique to this parasite. Additionally, unlike Nosema algerae, its development occurred at warm blooded host temperature (37-38 degrees C) and unlike Nosema connori, which disseminates to all tissue types, B. vesicularum infected only muscle cells. Thus, a new genus and species is proposed. Because of the similarities with the genus Nosema, this new genus is placed in the family Nosematidae. Successful clearing of this infection (both clinically and histologically) resulted from treatment with albendazole and itraconozole.",,,

Knowledge of their diseases, including high levels of research on Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague), show that disease plays a vital role during crayfish invasions. Microsporidian diseases in crayfish are less studied but are thought to have important links to crayfish health and invasion dynamics. In this study we provide a systematic description of a novel microsporidian parasite from the Floridian crayfish, Procambarus paeninsulanus, with additional genetic identification from related Microsporidia from Procambarus fallax, Cambarellus shufeldtii and Cambarellus blacki. This novel microsporidium from P. paeninsulanus is described in a new genus, Cambaraspora, and species, Cambaraspora floridanus, and represents a novel member of the Clade V Microsporidia within the Glugeidae. The parasite develops in the muscle tissue of P. paeninsulanus, within a sporophorous vesicle, and produces a spore with 19-21 turns of the polar filament measuring 6.136 ± 0.84 µm in length and 2.12 ± 0.23 µm in width. The muscle-infecting nature of the parasite suggests that it is horizontally transmitted. Genetic data for the 18S of the parasite from all hosts confirms its assignment to Clade V and reveal it to be a relative of multiple fish-infecting parasites. It shows closest genetic relationship to Glugea plecoglossi, but branches alongside multiple microsporidia from fish, crustaceans and eDNA isolates. The information presented here suggests that this novel parasite may have the potential to infect piscine hosts and is a likely mortality driver in the P. paeninsulanus population. Its potential as a control agent or wildlife disease invasion threat is explored, as well as the placement of this novel microsporidium within the Glugeidae.","USA (Florida, Wacisaa River, Jefferson County)",United States (Wacisaa River | Florida | Jefferson City),United States ()

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial reproduction was not observed. the sporogony comprises two sequences: one with free spores in parasitophorous vacuoles, the other in spherical, 5.6‐6.8 μm wide, sporophorous vesicles which lie in the cytoplasm. the free sporogony yields more than 20 spores per sporont. the vesicle‐bound sporogony produces 8, 12 or 16 spores. the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle is about 82 nm thick and layered. the internal layer is the plasma membrane of the sporont; the surface layer is electron dense with regularly arranged translucent components. Both spore types are spherical. They have an ∼ 35‐nm thick spore wall, with a plasma membrane, an electron‐lucent endospore, and an ∼ 14‐nm thick electron‐dense exospore. the polar sac is cup‐like and lacks a layered anchoring disc. the polar filament is arranged in two to three isofilar coils in the half of the spore opposite the nucleus. the coupling between the polar sac and the polar filament is characteristic. the surface of the polar filament is covered with regularly arranged membraneous chambers resembling a honeycomb. There is no polaroplast of traditional type. the cytoplasm lacks polyribosomes. the nucleus has a prominent, wide nucleolus. the two spore types have identical construction, but differ in dimensions and electron density. Free living spores are about 3.2 μm wide, the diameter of the polar filament proper is 102‐187 nm, the chambers of the honeycomb are 70‐85 nm high, and the polar sac is up to 425 nm wide.

It was found in a soil sample from Utah (USA), pure cultures were not available. The developmental stages seen are uninucleate and divide by binary fission (disporoblastic). Each sporont is enveloped by a membranelike exospore precursor and a parasitophorous vacuole deriving from host endoplasmic reticulum and persisting during spore maturation. The spore is rod-shaped with hemispherical ends and measures about 4×2 μm. It has a short, uncoiled polar filament and conspicuous, possibly transient sacs in the wide anterior lamellae of the bipartite polaroplast. The exospore has the appearance of a unit membrane. Maturing spores induce the formation of appendages (“feet”) at the posterior end of the host which was thus formerly assigned to the genus Cirrophrya. However, our study shows that the feet are a pathological phenomenon and the host thus belongs to the genus Platyophrya: Platyophrya terricola (Foissner, 1987) nov. comb. Despite its unusual host, the fine structure of C. platyophryae is very similar to that of microsporidia from other invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Very likely, C. platyophryae is related to the genera Oligosporidium, Encephalitozoon, Unikaryon and Endoreticulatus, presently assigned to the families Encephalitozoonidae and/or Unikaryonidae. However, for a definite classification of C. platyophryae more detailed data on its life cycle and membranous envelopes are necessary. Thus, we prefer an incerta sedis position.","U.S.A.

We have analysed one of these subclades and we describe a new microsporidian genus and species combination, and assemble a large group of structurally indistinguishable microsporidian parasites that infect adipose cells of their hosts and form pyriform spores of a certain type (“obtuse spores”).

131,Cucumispora roeselii,"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii ::: BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",Poland,Poland (),Poland (); Commensals (); Europe (); United States (Dunn)

(microspora, glugeidae), a microsporidian parasite of the cabbage root fly Delia radicum (Linnaeus, 1758) (diptera, anthomyidae) ::: The microsporidium Cystosporogenes deliaradicae sp. no v., a parasite of the adipose tissue of adult cabbage root flies, Delia radicum in Denmark, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 4–16 (most commonly 6 or 8) ovocylindrical spores, measuring 1.2–1.5 × 4.6–5.5 μm when fixed and stained. The spore wall has an approximately 43 nm thick, layered exospore with a median layer resembling a double membrane. The polaroplast is uniformly lamellar. The isofilar, 114–123 nm thick, polar filament is arranged in 11–15 (most commonly 12–13) coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt is approximately 35°. The last coil touches the posterior pole of the spore. A sporophorous vesicle is produced by the sporont. The envelope is generated as a duplication of the plasma membrane. Typically the vesicle primordia grow from one pole of the sporont to the other. The episporontal space initially has granular inclusions. Later septate, persistent tubules of exospore material appear. Simultaneously with the release of sporoblasts, wide tubulus-like, non-persistent structures are formed. They are covered by regularly spaced electron-dense material. Anomalous sporogony was frequently observed, probably caused by a simultaneous parasitism by the fungus Strongwellsea castrans.

In hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of infected amphipods, the microsporidian was observed to infect muscle tissue surrounding the ovaries. Melanized hemocytic encapsulations were often observed in or near masses of microsporidians. The microsporidians appeared as spores measuring 1.99 ± 0.09 μm long by 1.19 ± 0.05 μm wide. Each spore contained eight coils of isofilar polar filaments that were arranged in single ranks. Polar filaments measured 71 ± 3 nm in diameter. A prominent lamellar polaroplast composed of ordered concentric membranes was found at the apical end of the spore surrounding the polar filament. A distinct posterior vacuole was observed at the distal end of the spore.

147,Duboscqia dengihilli,"Life cycle of a new species of Duboscqia (Microsporida: Thelohaniidae) infecting the mosquito Anopheles hilli and an intermediate copepod host, Apocyclops dengizicus ::: A new species of Microsporida, Duboscqia dengihilli, was found infecting larvae of the mosquito Anopheles hilli in northern Queensland, Australia. Laboratory experiments showed that binucleate spores formed within infected female mosquitoes were responsible for transovarial transmission to the next generation. Sporogony within the larval fat body was initiated by two diplokarya, one at each end of the cell, which undergo meiosis within a single sporophorous vesicle to form 16 meiospores. These spores are responsible for horizontal transmission to the copepod Apocyclops dengizicus. The microsporidium is transmitted back to the mosquito host via uninucleate pyriform spores formed within the copepod host which are infectious to larvae of A. hilli. The meronts within larvae infected by horizontal transmission ultimately develop into the binucleate spores within adult females to complete the life cycle. Thus, the development of this microsporidium involves vertical transmission between successive mosquito generations and horizontal transmission between mosquitoes and copepods similar to the life cycles of Amblyospora and Parathelohania.",Australia (north Queensland),Australia (North West Island),Australia (Queensland)

Establishing the new species was based on sequencing the ITS‐SSUrDNA region of the ribosomal gene and consequent SSUrDNA‐inferred phylogenetic analyses, as well as on comparison of pathogenesis, host specificity, and ultrastructure among Encephalitozoon species and isolates. The new species is closely related to E. lacertae and E. cuniculi. Analysis of the literature suggests that this microsporidium has been reported previously as an unidentified microsporidian species or isolate of E. cuniculi and may represent a common infection in bearded dragons. All stages of E. pogonae develop in parasitophorous vacuoles. Uninucleate spores on methanol‐fixed smears measured 2.1 × 1.1 μm, range 1.7–2.6 × 0.9–1.7 μm; on ultrathin sections spores measured 0.8–1.1 × 1.8–2.2 μm. Ultrastructural study revealed 3–6 polar filament coils, a mushroom‐shaped polar disk, and a polar sac embracing half of the volume occupied by the lamellar polaroplast.

The parasites (CDC:0291:V213) grew profusely in two of the cultures (HLF and E6) and extruded spores into the culture medium. The spores were Gram-positive, 2.25- to 2.8-microns long, 1.25- to 1.8-microns broad, and smooth-walled. Some of the spores had already extruded their polar tubes, which were either straight or slightly coiled. Infected host cells contained parasitophorous vacuoles filled with developing stages of the parasite, including mature spores. Each spore was surrounded by a thin, electron-dense exospore; a thick electron-lucent endospore; and a thin cell membrane. Cross-sections of six coils of the polar tube were seen inside the spore. Proteins extracted from spores of our isolate and those from Encephalitozoon cuniculi were separated on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and either silver-stained or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. As many as 35 bands, ranging in molecular mass from 10,000 to 200,000, were visualized in the silver-stained gel. When reacted with the serum of our patient, strips cut from the membrane showed a number of bands ranging in molecular weight from 25,000 to 200,000.

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed.

Two genera, Endoreticulatus and Cystosporogenes, clearly separate into distinct but closely related clades based on small subunit ribosomal RNA analysis but are included in different families that are each polyphyletic. A microsporidium with morphology resembling the Endoreticulatus/Cystosporogenes clade was isolated from the grasshopper Poecilimon thoracicus from a site in Northwest Bulgaria. It produced intense infections in the digestive tract of the host but no behavioral changes were noted in infected individuals. Prevalence of the microsporidium increased over the active feeding season yearly. Mature spores were oval and measured 2.58±0.21μm×1.34±0.24μm, with 16 to approximately 32 spores in a parasitophorous vacuole. The spores were uninucleate and polar filament coils numbered 8–9 situated in a single row. The spore polaroplast consisted of an anterior lamellar section and a posterior vesicular section, and the posterior vacuole was reduced. Analyses of a 1221bp partial SSU-rRNA sequence indicated that the isolate is more closely related to the Endoreticulatus clade than to Cystosporogenes, but shows earlier phylogenetic separation from species infecting Lepidoptera and represents a new species, Endoreticulatus poecilimonae. To compare sequences of Endoreticulatus spp. from Lepidoptera to those infecting other insect orders, an isolate, Microsporidium itiiti Malone (1985), described from the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, was sequenced.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations.

Different stages of the parasite are described, from early sporogonal plasmodia to mature spores in the cytoplasm of host-cells. The multinucleate sporogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm and contained numerous small blebs at the surface. Binary fission of the plasmodial nuclei occurred during early plasmodial development and numerous pre-sporoblasts were formed within the plasmodium. Electron-dense disks and precursors of the polar tubule developed in the cytoplasm of the plasmodium prior to budding of early sporoblasts from the plasmodial surface. Mature spores were oval, measuring 0.7×1.1μm and contained a single nucleus, 5–6 coils of the polar filament, a posterior vacuole, an anchoring disk attached to the polar filament, and a thick electron-dense wall. The wall was composed of a plasmalemma, an electron-lucent endospore (10nm) and an electron-dense exospore (2nm). DNA primers designed from microsporidian SSU rRNA were used to amplify an 848bp product from the parasite genome (GenBank Download FJ496356).

Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida.

183,Enterospora canceri,"Enterospora canceri n. gen., n. sp., intranuclear within the hepatopancreatocytes of the European edible crab Cancer pagurus ::: Only 1 genus (Nucleospora) within 1 family (Enterocytozoonidae) of the Microsporidia contains species that are parasitic within the nuclei of their host cells; to date, all described intranuclear Nucleospora spp. parasitise fish. This study describes the first intranuclear microsporidian parasite of an invertebrate, the European edible crab Cancer pagurus L. (Decapoda: Cancridae). Infected crabs displayed no obvious external signs, and maximum apparent prevalence of infection within a monthly sample was 3.45 %. Infected hepatopancreatic tubules were characterised by varying numbers of hypertrophic and eosinophilic nuclei within epithelial cells. Parasite stages appeared as eosinophilic granular accumulations causing margination of host chromatin. In advanced cases, the tubule epithelia degenerated, with parasites and sloughed epithelial cells appearing in tubule lumens. All life stages of the parasite were observed within host nuclei. Uninucleate meronts were not detected, although binucleate stages were observed. Multinucleate Plasmodia (sporogonal Plasmodia) contained up to 22 nuclei in section, and late-stage Plasmodia contained multiple copies of apparatus resembling the polar filament and anchoring disk, apparently associated with individual plasmodial nuclei. As such, aggregation and early assembly of sporoblast components took place within the intact sporogonial Plasmodium, a feature unique to the Enterocytozoonidae. Liberation of sporoblasts from Plasmodia or the presence of liberated sporoblasts was not observed in this study. However, large numbers of maturing and mature spores (measuring 1.3 ± 0.02 x 0.7 ± 0.01 μm) were frequently observed in direct contact with the host nucleoplasm. Considering the shared features of this parasite with microsporidians of the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the unique presence of this parasite within the nucleoplasm of decapod crustacean hepatopancreatocytes, this parasite (Enterospora canceri) is proposed as the type species of a new genus (Enterospora) of microsporidian.

184,Enterospora nucleophila,"A new intranuclear microsporidium, Enterospora nucleophila n. sp., causing an emaciative syndrome in a piscine host (Sparus aurata), prompts the redescription of the family Enterocytozoonidae ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • A new species of microsporidium is described from the intestine of a marine teleost. • The ultrastructural and molecular analyses place it within the Enterocytozoonidae. • The Enterocytozoonidae family is amended. • Intranuclear stages are free in the nucleoplasm and those in the cytoplasm are in a parasitophorous vacuole. • This microsporidium is a potential threat for cultured fish as it drastically reduces growth. Abstract The presence of a new microsporidium is believed to be responsible for an emaciative syndrome observed in farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) from different facilities along the Spanish coast. Infected fish were approximately half the average weight and significant mortality was attributed to the condition in some facilities. Clinical signs included anorexia, cachexia and pale internal organs. The microsporidium was found mainly in the intestinal mucosa and occasionally in the submucosa. Morphological, histopathological, ultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic studies were conducted to characterise this organism. This microsporidium undergoes intranuclear development in rodlet cells and enterocytes, and cytoplasmic development mainly in enterocytes and macrophages. The nucleus-infecting plasmodium contains several diplokarya and displays polysporous development which occurs without an interfacial envelope. In the host cell cytoplasm, the parasite develops within a membrane-bound matrix. In both infection locations, the polar tube precursors appear as disks, first with lucent centres, then as fully dense disks as they fuse to form the polar filament, all before division of the plasmodium into sporoblasts. Up to 16 intranuclear spores result from the sporogonic development of a single plasmodium, whereas more than 40 spores result from several asynchronous reproductive cycles in the cytoplasmic infection. Fixed spores are ellipsoidal and diplokaryotic, with five to six coils of an isofilar polar filament in a single row. ssrDNA-based molecular phylogenetic inference places this parasite as a sister clade to crustacean-infecting species of the Enterocytozoonidae and closer to Enterocytozoon bieneusi than to other fish-infecting microsporidians presenting intranuclear development, i.e. Nucleospora, Paranucleospora and Desmozoon. Our studies result in the erection of a new species, Enterospora nucleophila, within the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the description of this family is amended accordingly to accommodate the features of known species assigned to it. Severe histopathological damage occurs in intense infections and this microsporidian is considered a serious emerging threat in sea bream production.",Spain,Spain (),

(Microspora, Gurleyidae) ::: The microsporidium Episeptum inversum gen. et sp. nov. (fam. Gurleyidae) is a parasite of the caddisfly Holocentropus picicornis (Polycentropodidae) in southern Sweden. Infection is restricted to the adipose tissue. Infected cells and their nuclei are hypertrophied, and in the final phase disintegrated. In the merogonial development multinucleate plasmodia with isolated nuclei give rise to numerous uninucleate merozoites, which mature to uninucleate sporonts. The tetranucleate sporogonial plasmodium is divided into four symmetrical lobes, and finally four rounded uninucleate sporoblasts are budded off. Sporogonial plasmodium and sporoblasts are enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle, produced by the sporont, with a thin electron-dense envelope and a fibrillar content. The vesicle is subpersistent and disappears at spore maturation. Mature spores are always free and ungrouped, even in situ in the host. Spores are pyriform, c. 2.1 X 2.5-3.2 Itm unfixed, 1.2-1.6 X 2.1-2.6,am fixed and stained. The membrane-lined posterior vacuole is visible also in unfixed spores, in an oblique position close to the posterior pole. The uninucleate spores have a polaroplast with two lamellar parts. The anterior lamellae are wide, the posterior ones narrow. The polar filament is anisofilar, with 3 wide (130-140 nm) anterior coils and 2 to 3 narrow (108-113 nm) posterior coils in a single layer close to the spore wall.

A new microsporidian species, Euplotespora binucleata n. gen., n. sp., from the brackish-water ciliate Euplotes woodruffi is described and defined on the basis of life history characteristics, light and electron microscopic features, and small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. The life cycle of E. binucleata n. sp. probably has rather short merogonic and relatively long sporogonic phases. Some uninuclear meronts and sporonts, along with diplokaryotic sporoblasts and spores, were found in experimentally infected host cells. Such a peculiar life cycle has been induced experimentally in Euplotes eurystomus and constitutively microsporidian-free stocks of E. woodruffi. Spores of E. binucleata n. sp. are monomorphic, ovoid–cylindrical in shape, 3.44±0.17 × 1.65±0.22 μm in size, and characterized by a diplokaryotic condition and a large posterior vacuole. The polar tube is isofilar, 4.5–5.5 μm in length when ejected, and lacking a distinctive coiled region (half-coiled). The polaroplast is divided into two regions: the anterior part has a few lamellae close to the anchoring disc; and the posterior part is a rounded body (sack), about one-quarter of the spore length. Spores do not appear to cluster together as a group. Each spore is surrounded by a sporophorous membrane closely adjacent to the exospore layer. A phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA sequences by different methods placed E. binucleata n. sp. in a clade with representatives of the microsporidian genera Cystosporogenes and Vittaforma.

Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a partial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequence identified a genetically distinct variety of Desmozoon lepeophtherii from Lepeophtheirus salmonis on cultured Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and this was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis resolved the SSU rDNA sequence of the second organism in a unique lineage that was most similar to microsporidia from marine and brackish water crustaceans. The second occurred in L. salmonis on Atlantic, sockeye Oncorhynchus nerka, chum O. keta and coho O. kisutch salmon, in Lepeophtheirus cuneifer on Atlantic salmon, and in Lepeophtheirus parviventris on Irish Lord Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus.

Here we examine Crangonyx pseudogracilis, a North American amphipod invasive in the United Kingdom and describe a novel microsporidium, Fibrillanosema crangonycis n.sp., n.g. The primary site of infection is the female gonad and the parasite is transovarially transmitted to the eggs. PCR screening reveals a female bias in the distribution of parasites (96.6% of females, N = 29; 22.2% of males, N = 27), which is indicative of host sex ratio distortion. The morphological and molecular characterisations of this new microsporidium place it outside all currently established genera. On the basis of these differences, we erect the new genus Fibrillanosema n.g. While F. crangonycis is morphologically identical to uncharacterised microsporidia from populations of North American amphipods, it is distinct from microsporidia found in European populations of amphipods. These data support the hypothesis that vertically transmitted parasites may be selectively retained during invasion events. Furthermore where vertical transmission is combined with host sex ratio distortion these parasites may directly enhance host invasion success through increased rates of population growth. © 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

The non-xenoma-forming microsporidium occurred diffusely in most internal organs and the gill, thus referring to the condition as tetra disseminated microsporidiosis (TDM). The occurrence of TDM in black tetra was associated with chronic mortality in a domestic farmed population, while the case in cardinal tetra occurred in moribund fish while in quarantine at a public aquarium. Histology showed that coelomic visceral organs were frequently necrotic and severely disrupted by extensive infiltrates of macrophages. Infected macrophages were presumed responsible for the dissemination of spores throughout the body. Ultrastructural characteristics of the parasite developmental cycle included uninucleate meronts directly in the host cell cytoplasm. Sporonts were bi-nucleated as a result of karyokinesis and a parasite-produced sporophorous vesicle (SPV) became apparent at this stage. Cytokinesis resulted in two spores forming within each SPV. Spores were uniform in size, measuring about 3.9 ± 0.33 long by 2.0 ± 0.2 μm wide. Ultrastructure demonstrated two spore types, one with 9-12 polar filament coils and a double-layered exospore and a second type with 4-7 polar filament coils and a homogenously electron-dense exospore, with differences perhaps related to parasite transmission mechanisms.

202,Globosporidium paramecii,"The first case of microsporidiosis in Paramecium ::: A new microsporidian species, Globosporidium paramecii gen. nov., sp. nov., from Paramecium primaurelia is described on the basis of morphology, fine structure, and SSU rRNA gene sequence. This is the first case of microsporidiosis in Paramecium reported so far. All observed stages of the life cycle are monokaryotic. The parasites develop in the cytoplasm, at least some part of the population in endoplasmic reticulum and its derivates. Meronts divide by binary fission. Sporogonial plasmodium divides by rosette-like budding. Early sporoblasts demonstrate a well-developed exospore forming blister-like structures. Spores with distinctive spherical shape are dimorphic in size (3.7 ± 0.2 and 1.9 ± 0.2 μm). Both types of spores are characterized by a thin endospore, a short isofilar polar tube making one incomplete coil, a bipartite polaroplast, and a large posterior vacuole. Experimental infection was successful for 5 of 10 tested strains of the Paramecium aurelia species complex. All susceptible strains belong to closely related P. primaurelia and P. pentaurelia species. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new species in the Clade 4 of Microsporidia and revealed its close relationship to Euplotespora binucleata (a microsporidium from the ciliate Euplotes woodruffi), to Helmichia lacustris and Mrazekia macrocyclopis, microsporidia from aquatic invertebrates.",Spain,Spain (),

In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm.

The microsporidian formed large whitish xenomas adhering to the peritoneal visceral organs of the host. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic cell, in the cytoplasm of which mature spores proliferated within parasitophorous vacuoles surrounded by numerous collagen fibers. Mature spores were ellipsoidal and uninucleated, measuring an average of 6.5 ± 0.5 μm in length and 3.4 ± 0.6 μm in width. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, laterally shifted from the anterior pole of the spore. The isofilar polar filament coiled in 18–19 turns, forming two rows that surrounded the posterior vacuole. The latter occupied about one third of the spore length. The polaroplast surrounding the apical and uncoiled portion of the polar filament displayed two distinct regions: a lamellar region and an electron-dense globule. Molecular analysis of the rRNA genes, including the internal transcribed spacer region, and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and neighbor joining demonstrated that this microsporidian parasite clustered with some Glugea species.

This parasite develops in the subcutaneous tissue of the body and fins, forming spherical xenomas about 1-2 mm in diameter surrounded by a layer of amorphous material. The observed characteristics of the new parasite are in line with those of the other Glugea species; merogony takes place in the outer zone of the cytoplasm of the host cell, sporogony takes place in sporophorous vesicles, and mature spores are located in the central part of the xenoma. Meronts were cylindrical uninucleate or occasionally triradiate multinucleate, with plasmodia in direct contact with the host cytoplasm. Sporogonic plasmodia divided by multiple cleavage to produce sporoblast mother cells, which after binary fission became sporoblasts. Two types of spores were recognized, both uninucleate, i.e., ovoid or slightly ovoid microspores with a mean size of 5.1 × 2.2 μm and much less frequent as elongated oval macrospores with a mean size of 8.9 × 3.1 μm. The polar tube has between 12 and 14 coils arranged in 1, 2, or 3 layers.

This parasite was previously identified as Octosporea bayeri Jírovec, 1936 and has become a model system to study the ecology, epidemiology, evolution and genomics of microsporidia - host interactions. Here, we present evidence that shows its differences from O. bayeri. Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis exclusively infects the adipose tissue, the ovaries and the hypodermis of Daphnia magna and is found only in host populations located in coastal rock pool populations in Finland and Sweden. Merogonial stages of H. tvaerminnensis have isolated nuclei; merozoites are formed by binary fission or by the cleaving of a plasmodium with a small number of nuclei. A sporogonial plasmodium with isolated nuclei yields 8 sporoblasts. Elongated spores are generated by the most finger-like plasmodia. The mature spores are polymorphic in shape and size. Most spores are pyriform (4·9–5·6×2·2–2·3 μm) and have their polar filament arranged in 12–13 coils. A second, elongated spore type (6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm) is rod-shaped with blunt ends and measures 6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm. The envelope of the sporophorous vesicle is thin and fragile, formed at the beginning of the sporogony. Cytological and molecular comparisons with Flabelliforma magnivora, a parasite infecting the same tissues in the same host species, reveal that these two species are very closely related, yet distinct. Moreover, both cytological and molecular data indicate that these species are quite distant from F. montana, the type species of the genus Flabelliforma.

(Microspora, Thelohaniidae): morphology, development and influence on salivary glands of Chironomus anthracinus (Diptera, Chironomidae) ::: Helmichia glandulicola, a microsporidian parasite specific for cells of the salivary glands of the midge Chironomus anthracinus, is described. It is characterized by tubular spores with a distinct polar cap that are enclosed in persistent octosporous pansporoblasts. The pansporoblastic membrane is formed early during the first sporogonial division. A granular secretion occurs in the pansporoblast among the oval sporoblasts, which subsequently become tubular and display a rigid polar filament. The solitary infected cell reacts with hypertrophy and depletion of its endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomal system. There are differences in the morphology of mitochondria in infected vs noninfected cells. The production of saliva by the host is only partially reduced following infection. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Norway (Apeltunvatnet near Bergen),Norway (Apeltunvatnet near Bergen),

(Microsporidia: Glugeidae) infecting the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus (Pisces: Synodontidae) inhabiting the Red Sea ::: Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease distributed worldwide, impacting wild and farmed-raised fish in both fresh and marine water environments. Twenty three out of 130 (17.69%) of the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus were found to be naturally infected with microsporidian parasites. The rate of parasitic infection was increased during winter reaching 29.23% (19/65) and fall to 6.15% (4/65) in summer. The infection was recorded as numerous macroscopic whitish cysts reached 3.8–6.5 mm in diameter embedded in the abdominal cavity, skeletal muscles and mesenteric tissues of the infected fish inducing an enormous hypertrophy of infected tissues. Light microscopic examination revealed that parasitic foci were encapsulated by a host–derived fibrous membrane containing different developmental stages of the parasite. Spores were oval to pyriform in shape. Transmission electron microscopic study showed the presence of smooth membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forming a thick, amorphous coat surrounding the various developmental stages of the examined parasite (meronts, sporont, sporoblasts, and spores). Mature spores were electron dense and uninucleate. The anchoring disk was found in a central position at the anterior end of the spore and a large vacuole was located at the posterior end. There was a definite number (7–8) of the polar filament turns. Molecular analysis based on the 16 small subunit (SSU) rDNA gene was performed to determine the phylogenetic position of the present parasite species. A 615 bp region of the 16SSU rDNA gene of the studied parasite was sequenced and deposited in GenBank under the accession number MF769371. Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated a high degree of similarity (>82%) with other twenty microsporidian species isolated from different aquatic hosts. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry JF745533 for Heterosporis saurida isolated from the marine fish Saurida undosquamis with the highest percentage of identity (98%) and lowest divergence value (0.9).

An apparently identical species was also found in Ancistrus cirrhosus (Loricariidae). Early meronts — uninucleate or plurinucleate — are perhaps responsible for dissemination of the infection throughout the muscle tissue. Later development of the microsporidian takes place in a structure encased with a thick envelope, for which the name sporophorocyst is proposed. At first, it contains merogony stages. Later, sporogony stages appear, too, which eventually prevail until a voluminous sporophorocyst is packed full with sporophorous vesicles with macrospores and rather rare microspores.",Germany,Germany (),
236,Heterosporis sutherlandae,"Description of the Microsporidian Parasite, Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp., Infecting Fish in the Great Lakes Region, USA ::: Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease worldwide, impacting wild and farmed raised fishes in both marine and freshwater environments. A previously undescribed species (Heterosporis sp.), with widespread distribution in the Great Lakes region, was the subject of this study. Three angler-caught fish were submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from 2009–2010 with lesions caused by intracellular proliferation of parasitic spores, resulting in destruction and eventual widespread necrosis of the host skeletal muscles. Mature ovoid (5.8 x 3.5μm) spores of a microsporidian parasite, consistent with the genus Heterosporis, were observed by light and electron microscopy. Molecular identification was performed using primer walking to obtain a near-complete rRNA gene sequence (~3,600 bp). A unique species of Heterosporis was identified, demonstrating less than 96% sequence identity to other published Heterosporis sp. on the basis of partial rRNA gene sequence analysis. Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp. (formerly Heterosporis sp.) was identified in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), northern pike (Esox lucius) and walleye (Sander vitreus) from inland lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Sp., a Microsporidian Parasite of the Blackfly Odagmia Ornata ::: Hyalinocysta expilatoria n. sp. is described from a larva of Odagmiu oornata collected in Sweden. Infection was restricted to the adipose tissue which was transformed into a syncytium. The earliest stage observed was diplokaryotic merozoites, which mature directly into diplokaryotic sporonts. Each sporont produces a sporophorous vesicle (pansporoblast), which persists, also enclosing mature spores. Usually nuclear divisions result in a plasmodium with 8 nuclei, which fragments into 8 sporoblasts, each of which develops into a spore without further division. Occasionally an aberrant number of spores (2, 4, 6) is formed. The spores are pyriform with a flattened area at the posterior pole. Spores in sporophorous vesicles with 8 spores are 4.0-6.0 μm long, in vesicles with 4 spores 4.0-5.0 μm, and in vesicles with 2 spores 7.0-8.0 μm. In some vesicles the spores develop asynchronously, and 2, 4, or 6 mature spores are found together with 6, 4, or 2 immature. There was also a small number of vesicles with supernumerary spores, less than 8 normally developed. The 325-350 nm thick spore wall is composed of three layers. The polar filament is anisofilar with 7 coils in a single layer. The anterior 5-6 coils are wide, the posterior 2-l thin. The angle of tilt of the anterior filament coil is approximately 50°, The spore has a single nucleus. The sporophorous vesicle is delimited by a thin membrane, also visible in haematoxylin stained preparations. Vesicles with mature spores are void of metabolic inclusions.",Sweden,Sweden (),Sweden ()
241,Hyperspora aquatica,"Hyperspora aquatica n.gn., n.sp. (Microsporidia), hyperparasitic in Marteilia cochillia (Paramyxida), is closely related to crustacean-infecting microspordian taxa ::: SUMMARY The Paramyxida, closely related to haplosporidians, paradinids, and mikrocytids, is an obscure order of parasitic protists within the class Ascetosporea. All characterized ascetosporeans are parasites of invertebrate hosts, including molluscs, crustaceans and polychaetes. Representatives of the genus Marteilia are the best studied paramyxids, largely due to their impact on cultured oyster stocks, and their listing in international legislative frameworks. Although several examples of microsporidian hyperparasitism of paramyxids have been reported, phylogenetic data for these taxa are lacking. Recently, a microsporidian parasite was described infecting the paramyxid Marteilia cochillia, a serious pathogen of European cockles. In the current study, we investigated the phylogeny of the microsporidian hyperparasite infecting M. cochillia in cockles and, a further hyperparasite, Unikaryon legeri infecting the digenean Meiogymnophallus minutus, also in cockles. We show that rather than representing basally branching taxa in the increasingly replete Cryptomycota/Rozellomycota outgroup (containing taxa such as Mitosporidium and Paramicrosoridium), these hyperparasites instead group with other known microsporidian parasites infecting aquatic crustaceans. In doing so, we erect a new genus and species (Hyperspora aquatica n. gn., n.sp.) to contain the hyperparasite of M. cochillia and clarify the phylogenetic position of U. legeri. We propose that in both cases, hyperparasitism may provide a strategy for the vectoring of microsporidians between hosts of different trophic status (e.g. molluscs to crustaceans) within aquatic systems. In particular, we propose that the paramyxid hyperparasite H. aquatica may eventually be detected as a parasite of marine crustaceans. The potential route of transmission of the microsporidian between the paramyxid (in its host cockle) to crustaceans, and, the ‘hitch-hiking’ strategy employed by H. aquatica is discussed.",Spain,Spain (),
242,Ichthyosporidium weissii,"Ichthyosporidium weissii n. sp. (Microsporidia) Infecting the Arrow Goby ( Clevelandia ios) ::: Abstract Gonadal infections by a novel microsporidium were discovered in 34% (13/38) of arrow gobies, Clevelandia ios, sampled over a 3‐yr period from Morro Bay Marina in Morro Bay, California. Gonadal tumors had been reported in arrow gobies from this geographic area. The infected gonads, found primarily in females, typically appeared grossly as large, white‐gray firm and lobulated masses. Histological examination revealed large, multilobate xenomas within the ovaries and no evidence of neoplasia. Typical of the genus Ichthyosporidium, the large xenomas were filled with developmental stages and pleomorphic spores. Wet mount preparations showed two general spore types: microspores with mean length of 6.2 (7.0–4.9, SD = 0.6, N = 20) μm and mean width of 4.3 (5.3–2.9, SD = 0.8) μm; and less numerous macrospores with mean length of 8.5 (10.1–7.1, SD = 1.0, N = 10) μm and mean width of 5.5 (6.2–4.8, SD = 0.5) μm. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated stages consistent with the genus and 35–50 turns of the polar filament. Small subunit rDNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the parasite from arrow gobies was most closely related to, but distinct from Ichthyosporidium sp. based on sequences available in GenBank. We conclude that this microsporidium represents a new species of Ichthyosporidium, the first species of this genus described from a member of the family Gobiidae and from the Pacific Ocean.","(California, Morro Bay) U.S.A.",United States (Morro Bay | California),United States (Morro Bay State Park Marina | Morro Bay | California); Pacific Ocean ()

Reproduction is restricted to the production of sporoblasts. The sporont has isolated nuclei, and the external pan of the sporont (plasma membrane and peripheral zone of cytoplasm) remains as an envelope collecting the uninucleate sporoblasts. Sporogony is by vacuolation, and mature spores are spherical to slightly ovoid and lack a polaroplast. Microspores (1.3-1.7 μm wide) are dominant, and only a small percentage of macrospores (1.5-2.3 μm wide) were seen. The exospore is composed as a thin (ca 16 nm) uniform, electron-dense layer; the endospore is well developed. The polar filament is completely coiled and anisofilar, and in microspores arranged in 2-3 coils (anterior 1-2 wider); macrospores have up to 9 coils (anterior 3-4 wider).

Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts. Although it was similar to species of Amblyospora in host/parasite relations, we would rather assign this parasite to a newly established genus, i.e. Intrapredatorus and the name Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. was given for this microsporidium.

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are formed by rosette‐like division. Sporonts develop into sporogonial plasmodia with isolated nuclei. These plasmodia give rise to 8–16 sporoblasts by rosette‐like budding. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Sporoblasts and spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. Granular inclusions of the vesicles, visible using light microscopy, discriminate sporogonial stages from stages of the merogony. The monokaryotic, fresh spores are oval with blunt ends, measuring 4.2‐6.3 × 9.1‐11.2 μm. Macrospores are formed in small numbers. The spore wall has three subdivisions and the exospore is electron‐dense. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, wider sac‐like compartments posteriorly. The isofilar polar filament, 191–264 nm wide, has 12‐13 coils, which are arranged in one layer in the posterior half of the spore. The electron‐dense inclusions of the sporophorous vesicle are modified during sporogony, and vesicles with mature spores are traversed by 21–27 nm wide tubules, which connect the exospore with the envelope of the vesicle. The walls of the tubules, the envelope of the vesicles, and the surface layer of the exospore are all identical double‐layered structures.

Infected chironomid larvae with hypertrophied adipose tissue exhibited porcelain-white. All developmental stages possessed large nuclei. The earliest stages observed were diplokaryotic meronts which were in direct contact with the host adipocyte cytoplasm. Diplokaryotic meronts developed into sporonts with the deposition of electron-dense coagulum on their surface. Multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia developed into uninucleate sporoblasts by the rosette-like division. Mature spores were oval and monokaryotic, measuring 6.14 ± 0.27 (5.65-6.67) µm long and 3.71 ± 0.12 (3.43-3.98) µm wide. Bipartite polaroplast consisted of a narrow anterior lamella and a wide posterior lamella. Isofilar polar filaments coiled 13-17 turns and arranged in one row. The exospore was thin and of no stratification, but remarkably covered with tubular secretions. The electron-lucent endospore was thick and measured 145-352 nm wide.

Several other parasites (Cryptocotyle sp., protozoan ciliates and Gyrodactylus sp.) were also found in gills. In June 2013, the mortality in a farmed lumpfish population increased to 65%. Lumpfish showed erratic swimming behaviour and loss of weight. At necropsy, nodules in the kidney were the only visible lesions. Histologically, all fish showed severe changes with gill inflammation and necrosis in the spleen, kidney and liver. Haemorrhages and necrosis were observed in some hearts. Intracellular microsporidians associated with the lesions were detected in most organs using histological examination and Calcofluor White. Kudoa spores were diagnosed in the skeletal muscle, but no inflammatory response was associated with the presence of the plasmodia. Comparison of 18S ribosomal DNA sequences showed 100% similarity to Kudoa islandica and Nucleospora cyclopteri.

(Opisthosporidia, Microsporidia), Parasite of Megacyclops viridis (Crustacea, Copepoda): Fine Structure and Molecular Phylogeny ::: Lanatospora costatasp. n., a new microsporidian parasite of the adipose and connective tissue cells of Megacyclops viridis (Jurine, 1820) (Copepoda: Cyclopidae) is described. It was isolated from a woodland pool with a rich and diverse fauna of microsporidia-infected small crustaceans and insect larvae. The parasite is structurally similar to the genus Lanatospora Voronin, 1989, characterized by a complex decorated exospore. In the described species the exospore is armoured by a conspicuous layer of interwoven ribs forming labyrinth on the spore surface. SSU rRNA phylogeny places the organism in the “aquatic outgroup” of microsporidia (Vossbrinck et al. 2004), which includes a number of microsporidia from aquatic microcrustacea of the classes Copepoda and Cladocera. The increasing number of available SSU rRNA gene sequences of these microsporidia allows a more detailed interpretation of their developmental histories.","(town Přerov nad Labem, Central Bohemia Region) Czech Republic",Czech Republic (town Přerov nad Labem | Central Bohemia),Woodland Pool I.

267,Liebermannia covasacrae,"Morphology and taxonomy of the microsporidium Liebermannia covasacrae n. sp. from the grasshopper Covasacris pallidinota (Orthoptera, Acrididae) ::: Abstract During a survey for grasshopper pathogens in Argentina in 2005–2006, individual Covasacris pallidinota from halophylous grasslands in Laprida, Buenos Aires province were found to be infected with a microsporidium. Infection was restricted to the salivary gland epithelial cells. The microsporidium produced ovocylindrical spores averaging 2.6±0.28×1.4±0.12μm (range 2.2–3.4×1.1–1.7μm), which resembled in size and shape the spores of Liebermannia patagonica and L. dichroplusae, two recently described species that also parasitize Argentine grasshoppers. The life cycle of the microsporidium included the formation of polynucleate, diplokaryotic, moniliform, merogonial plasmodia wrapped in flattened cisterns of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Plasmodia divided to produce diplokaryotic cells. The latter underwent elongation, dissociation of diplokarya counterparts, vacuolization, dismantling of the host ER envelope, and deposition of electron-dense material outside the plasma membrane. The resultant binucleate sporogonial plasmodia divided into two uninucleate sporoblasts, which eventually transformed into spores. Uninucleate spores contained a lamellar polaroplast, embraced by an elongated polar sac, anchoring disc, 3–5 polar filament coils, and a cluster of anastomizing tubules (sporoblast trans-Golgi, posterosome) at the posterior end. Sequence similarity of the SSU rDNA of the newly discovered microsporidium (Genbank accession no. Download EU709818) to L. patagonica and L. dichroplusae was 99% and 97%, respectively, suggesting that the three species belong to one genus. All three species fell into one clade in SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic trees produced by neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses with 100% statistical support. We assign the name Liebermannia covasacrae to this microsporidium. It can be easily differentiated from both congeners by host species, tissue tropism, type of sporogony, and several features of morphology. Comparison of the three Liebermannia spp. demonstrates that the nuclear phase (dikaryotic versus monokaryotic spores) and type of sporogony (polysporous versus disporous) may vary in closely related species.",Argentina,Argentina (),Argentina (Laprida | Buenos Aires)

Mortalities of varying severity occur at this hatchery every fall, and the microsporidian was noted during an experiment from August 1991 to January 1992 to determine the effects of water source on disease. Infections first appeared to be systemic in the October sample; xenomas were observed in heart, spleen, and peripheral vessel walls. The presence of unidentified intracellular material preceded the appearance of xenomas in all tissues, but whether this material was associated with inflammation or represented immature stages of the parasite has yet to be determined. These structures were also noted in the intestine and liver, although xenomas were not noted in these organs. Mature xenomas did not elicit an inflammatory response but appeared to be short-lived. When the xenoma wall ruptured and released spores, an inflammatory response was again observed. The prevalence and severity of the infection were determined in fish maintained in troughs with well water, Chattahoochee River water, or hatchery (treated river) water. The infection tended to be more prevalent and more severe in fish maintained in the hatchery or river water than in those maintained in the well water.

At the onset of sporogony the two nuclei of the diplokaryon separated and the electron-dense coat was sloughed off. Nuclear division and cytoplasmic division gave rise to uninucleate sporoblasts and spores. Adult M. africana collected at one of the three sites were infected with two diplokaryotic microsporidia, designated Type A and Type B, which differed only in the size of the spores. Spores of Type A measured 3.4 ×1.8 •m and those of Type B measured 6.6 × 2.9 •m; both types were binucleate. Type A infected 10.8 and Type B 5.8% of the adults collected. Mixed infections were not observed. In transovarial transmission trials, larvae were not successfully reared from adults infected with Type B. However, 11.3% of progeny from females infected with Type A exhibited multisporous microsporidian infections indistinguishable from those found in larvae collected at that site, showing that the multisporous parasite in larvae and the Type A infection of adults represent different stages in the life cycle of a single species. The morphology and life cycle of this microsporidian exclude it from all other related genera and it is attributed here to a new genus and given the name Merocinta davidii.",Tanzania (Northeast Muheza),Tanzania (Northeast Muheza),Tanzania ()
293,Metchnikovella sp. (?),"The influence of an eucaryotic intranuclear cell parasite on the production of gemmules in Ephydatia fluviatilis (Porifera, Spongillidae) ::: A prerequisite for the production of gemmules is the presence of intact archaeocytes and trophocytes, which give rise to the thesocytes with which the gemmule is eventually filled. The coat enclosing the gemmule requires spongioblasts for its formation and incorporates amphidisk spicules, which develop in amphidiskoblasts. The cell parasite, the development of which is described here, infects mainly archaeocytes but also spongioblasts and amphidiskoblasts. Even a moderate infection results in significant malformation of the gemmule covering. In the thesocyte nucleus, the parasite can survive the resting phase of the gemmule. After the gemmule has hatched, the parasite, again in the virulent form, is present in the young, developing sponge. The parasite may be a microsporidian of the primitive type, close to the genus Metchnikovella, which typically occurs in gregarines.",Germany (River Sieg near Au and Operzau),Germany (River Sieg near Au and Operzau),

(Microsporidia: Metchnikovellidae), with notes on the ultrastructure of metchnikovellids ::: SUMMARY The present paper reports results of a transmission electron microscopy study of a new metchikovellid microsporidium. It was isolated from gregarines Polyrhabdina sp. inhabiting guts of polychaetes Pygospio elegans sampled at the White Sea silt littoral zone. Free sporogony (FS) occurred in the life cycle of the microsporidium alongside sac-bound sporogony (BS). Free spores resided in a parasitophorous vacuole and were of typical metchnikovellidean structure, uninucleate and oblong. They measured on sections 2·0–3·2×1·3–1·9 μm. The life cycle included pre-sporogonial stages represented by dikaryotic cells and 4-nucleate cells with coupled nuclei. A multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium of FS split in numerous (>10) sporoblasts. In BS segregation of sporoblasts occurred within thick-walled cysts by internal budding. Spore sacs of this microsporidium, measuring on average 11·6×4·7 μm, were limited by a thick electron-dense wall, externally ornamented with spirally wound cords of dense material. These oval spore sacs contained eight barrel-shaped spores, comparable in size and ultrastructure to FS spores. Ultrastructure of both types of spores and intracellular development of the new microsporidium and Metchnikovella spp. were similar, suggesting they belong to the same genus.

This parasite developed in the liver forming whitish xenomas that contained different developmental stages with monokaryotic nuclei. The periphery of the xenoma presented some vacuolization and possessed several small projections in the membrane. The mature spores, measuring 3·8 ± 0·4 μm in length and 2·4 ± 0·4 μm in width, were slightly pyriform to ellipsoidal and had rounded ends. The polaroplast was bipartite and the isofilar polar filament was coiled with 8 – 9 turns in a single or double row at the posterior end of the spore. The nucleus was voluminous and in a central position, measuring ∼0·9 μm in diameter. A large posterior vacuole appeared as a pale area, occupying about a third of the spore length. The SSU rRNA gene was sequenced and analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour-joining methods.

Development occurs within xenomas (diameter 500μm) which have microvillar surfaces, encircling bands of mitochondria and a reticulate hypertrophic nucleus. Vegetative developmental stages, meronts, are plasmodial and divided by plasmotomy. These stages are enclosed by host membranes. Sporogonic stages are free in the cytoplasm and divide by multiple exogenous budding. Uninucleate spores (2·4μm × 4·2μm) possess 7–9 coils of the polar filament and a lamellar polaroplast. Xenomas are associated with liver connective tissue, and cause necrosis of adjacent liver cells in certain circumstances. Host response to infection involves leucocyte infiltration and granuloma formation, with spores being destroyed by repeated macrophage phagocytosis and necrosis and resulting in gradual resolution of the lesion. Although juveniles apparently tolerate large parasite burdens there is some evidence of a contribution by the parasite to stress‐related mortality.

The microsporidian forms macroscopic xenomas in the host liver which are packed with mature spores. Mature spores are slightly pyriform to oval in shape measuring 3.92 ± 0.21 μm in length and 2.87 ±0.16 pm in width. No pre-spore stages were observed during electron microscopy studies and mature spores had a single nucleus and 12-13 turns of an isofilar polar filament, arranged in two rows. Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA indicated a strong phylogenetic relationship within the Tetramicridae and to other members of the genus Microgemma. The most similar species in terms of genetic distance is M. carolinus with a similarity of 99.23% over 1295 bases of the small subunit of ribosomal DNA. However, differences in the number of turns of the polar filament combined with host and geographical differences, support M. tilanpasiri as a novel microsporidian species. This represents the first description of Microgemma from the Western Pacific and the first from the Gobiidae family of fishes. Related blackfin eel gobies from the same sampling site were found to be uninfected with M. tilanpasiri; however one fish was infected with Glugea sp. in the visceral mesentery. We conclude that in spite of the low genetic distances observed in ribosomal DNA sequences between geographically distant xenoma-forming microsporidians from both Microgemma and Glugea, that they probably represent a number of different species of parasite that may actually be quite host specific.",Malaysia,Malaysia (),Malaysia ()

Minimal estimates of the prevalence of the parasite in fishes caught along Tunisian coasts were as high as 43 % for Bizerte samples (over 2 yr) and 72 % for Monastir samples (over 3 yr). Developmental stages were dispersed within a xenoma structure that was bounded only by the plasma membrane of the hypertrophic host cell. Ultrastructural features support allocation to the genus Microgemma Ralphs and Matthews, 1986. Meronts were multinucleate plasmodia and were surrounded by rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of the host cell. Merogonic plasmodia developed into sporogonic plasmodia, with loss of the RER interface. Sporogony was polysporoblastic. Ovocylindrical spores (3.6 x 1.2 μm) harbored a lamellar polaroplast and a polar tube that was coiled 9 times. Spore features and host specificity led us to propose a new species, Microgemma tincae. The conversion of M. tincae xenomas into well-visible cyst structures or granulomas reflected an efficient host response involving the infiltration of phagocytic cells, degradation of various parasite stages and formation of a thick fibrous wall. The small subunit rDNA gene of M. tincae was partially sequenced.

(Microsporidia, Tetramicridae), Infecting Liver and Skeletal Muscle of Sea Scorpions, Taurulus bubalis (Euphrasen 1786) (Osteichthyes, Cottidae), an Inshore, Littoral Fish ::: Abstract. The ultrastructure of a new microsporidian species Microgemma vivaresi n. sp. causing liver cell xenoma formation in sea scorpions, Taurulus bubalis, is described. Stages of merogony, sporogony, and sporogenesis are mixed in the central cytoplasm of developing xenomas. All stages have unpaired nuclei. Uninucleate and multinucleate meronts lie within vacuoles formed from host endoplasmic reticulum and divide by binary or multiple fission. Sporonts, no longer in vacuoles, deposit plaques of surface coat on the plasma membrane that cause the surface to pucker. Division occurs at the puckered stage into sporoblast mother cells, on which plaques join up to complete the surface coat. A final binary fission gives rise to sporoblasts. A dense globule, thought to be involved in polar tube synthesis, is gradually dispersed during spore maturation. Spores are broadly ovoid, have a large posterior vacuole, and measure 3.6 μm × 2.1 μm (fresh). The polar tube has a short wide anterior section that constricts abruptly, then runs posteriad to coil about eight times around the posterior vacuole with granular contents. The polaroplast has up to 40 membranes arranged in pairs mostly attached to the wide region of the polar tube and directed posteriorly around a cytoplasm of a coarsely granular appearance. The species is placed alongside the type species Microgemma hepaticusRalphs and Matthews 1986 within the family Tetramicridae, which is transferred from the class Dihaplophasea to the class Haplophasea, as there is no evidence for the occurrence of a diplokaryotic phase.",England,England (),Australia (Inshore Island); xenomas ()

The spores of the microsporidian pathogen were slightly curved in shape, and measured 2.44-3.55 mu m in length and 1.25-1.55 mu m in width (n = 50). Its ultrastructure is characteristic of monokaryotic groups. All lifecycle stages of the pathogen, including meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts, and mature spores, are monokaryotic. The spore has 6-8 windings of the polar filament. Morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the lifecycle stages place it within the family Unikaryonidae. However, the phylogenetic tree constructed on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicates that the pathogen is closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha Glade of microsporidia. Therefore, we have classified the microsporidian of C. aurata in the tentative group Microsporidium in order to avoid creating an unnecessary or incorrect new genus/species.",Turkey,Turkey (),

Twenty three (30.6 %) out of 75 of the examined fish were parasitized with a microsporidian parasite. Numerous macroscopic whitish cysts embedded in the peritoneal cavity were observed to infect many organs of the body including muscles, connective tissues, and the intestinal epithelium. The infection was developed as tumor-like masses of often up to 5 mm in diameter inducing an enormous hypertrophy to the infected organs. Fresh spores appeared mostly ovoid to pyriform in shape reaching a size of 1.7 ± 0.5 (1.5–2.5) μm × 1.3 ± 0.4 (1–2) μm; they possessed a large vacuole at the posterior end. These spores were located within a sporophorous vesicle which was bound by a thick amorphous wall. The ultrastructural features support the placement of the present species within the genus Microsporidium. The developmental stages were enclosed within a xenoma structure that was bounded by a double-layered cyst wall. The life cycle of the microsporidian pathogen described herein included four stages: proliferation (merogony), sporogony, sporoblast, spores, and liberation. Mature spores appeared electron dense, uninucleate, and were ellipsoidal in shape. At the anterior end of the spore, the anchoring disk was found in a central position. There was a definite number (5–11) of turns of the polar tube. A 538-bp region of the SSU rDNA gene of the studied species was sequenced (GenBank accession number: KF0220444). Multiple sequence alignment calculated a high degree of similarity (>92 %) with six microsporidian species. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry AF151529 for Microsporidium prosopium isolated from Hyperoplus lanceolatus differing in 67 nucleotide positions in its SSU rDNA with the highest percentage of identity (97.2 %) and the lowest divergence value (0.20). Variations in the morphology of the spores and developmental stages between the two species revealed that the two species are different.

These xenomas are found in the skeletal muscle adjacent to the abdominal cavity. The xenoma wall, with an irregular surface, consists of concentric laminated layers of compressed cells, possibly fibroblasts. Developing cells are in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. Among the mature spores, small groups of juxtaposed immature spores are observed. The spores are ellipsoidal and uninucleate, measuring ∼ 2.95 × 1.68 μm (n = 50).

The polar tube consists of the anterior clavate manubrium followed by a thin filament arranged in 3.5-4.5 nearly vertical coils. Spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. SSU rDNA sequence analysis showed attribution of the new species to a cluster of microsporidia infecting insects (Cystosporogenes, Endoreticulatus), microsrustaceans (Glugoides), vertebrates (Vittaforma) and ciliates (Euplotespora) nested within the clade IV sensu Vossbrinck, Debrunner-Vossbrinck (2005). Mrazekia macrocyclopis is not therefore closely related to Bacillidium vesiculoformis, another microsporidium with rod-shaped spores, and the polyphyletic nature of the family of Mrazekiidae is obvious.",Russia,Russia (),Russia (); Botswana (North-West)
351,Multilamina teevani,"Multilamina teevani gen. et sp. nov., a microsporidian pathogen of the neotropical termite Uncitermes teevani ::: A new genus and species of microsporidia is described from adults of the termite Uncitermes teevani (Emerson) (n. comb., formerly Armitermes teevani), collected in Ecuador. Masses of elongate, ovoid, uninucleate spores were localized to the coelomic cavity of adult workers and measured 6.29×3.33μm (fresh) and 5.83×3.00μm (fixed). These spores were individually contained within a multi-layered sporophorous vesicle and contained an isofilar polar filament with 24–28 coils. Blast-n analysis revealed that the small subunit ribosomal DNA (ssrDNA) sequence of this new species exhibited 85% identity with that of a Varimorpha species from the fire ant, Solenopsis richteri, and slightly less (78–85% identity) to a large clade of microsporidian parasites from mosquitoes and microcrustacea.

Metanephrops challengeri were captured from an important marine fishery situated off the south coast of New Zealand. Infected lobsters displayed an unusual external appearance and were lethargic. Histology was used to demonstrate replacement of skeletal and other muscles by merogonic and sporogonic stages of the parasite, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of diplokaryotic meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts and spore stages, all in direct contact with the host sarcoplasm. Analysis of the ssrDNA gene sequence from the lobster microsporidian suggested a close affinity with Thelohania butleri, a morphologically dissimilar microsporidian from marine shrimps. Whilst morphological features of the lobster parasite are consistent with members of the family Nosematidae, molecular data place the parasite closer to members of the family Thelohanidae. Due to the contradiction between morphological and molecular taxonomic data, we propose the erection of a new genus in which the lobster parasite is the type species (Myospora metanephrops). Furthermore, we recommend the erection of a new family (Myosporidae) and a new order (Crustaceacida) to contain this genus. The taxonomic framework presented could be further applied to the re-classification of existing members of the Phylum Microsporidia.",(Auckland Islands) New Zealand,New Zealand (Auckland Islands),New Zealand ()
357,Myosporidium merluccius,"Myosporidium merluccius n. g., n. sp. Infecting Muscle of Commercial Hake (Merluccius sp.) from Fisheries near Namibia ::: Abstract. A new species of Microsporidia classified to a new genus was observed in the trunk muscle of commercial hake (Merluccius capensis/paradoxus complex) from Namibian fisheries. Macroscopic examination revealed thin and dark filaments inserted among muscle fibers. Inside the filaments were many sporophorous vesicles with about 30–50 spores per vesicle. The shape of the spore was pyriform and the extruded polar filament was of moderate length (up to 4.29 μm, n=12). This new species of Microsporidia is described using macrophotography, microphotography, staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as molecular methods. Its 16S rRNA was found to be similar to that of Microsporidium prosopium Kent et al., 1999, while both sequences were quite different from 16S rRNA sequences known for other Microsporidia. Nevertheless, this new species is separated morphologically from M. prosopium by the presence of 11–12 anisofilar coils and the formation of the xenoma at the site of infection.

358,Myosporidium spraguei,"Two Novel Microsporidia in Skeletal Muscle of Pike-Perch Sander lucioperca and Burbot Lota lota in Finland ::: Two new species of Microsporidia were recognized in skeletal muscle of freshwater fishes from Finland. Myosporidium spraguei n. sp. from pike-perch Sander lucioperca occurred as mature spores within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) within a xenoma. The ovoid spores were 3.8 μm long and 2.4 μm wide, based on transmission electron micrographs (TEM). The exospore and endospore were equally thick, the nucleus was monokaryotic and the polar filament was isofilar with 12 coils in a single rank, entirely adjacent to the prominent posterior vacuole. Small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequence confirmed the presence of M. spraguei n. sp. in burbot Lota lota . The second species, Microsporidium luciopercae n. sp., also from pike-perch, occurred within SPVs that occupied only a fraction of the volume of the otherwise intact myocyte; no xenoma was produced. Myocyte degeneration and necrosis occurred as mature spores dispersed into direct contact with the sarcoplasm. The ovoid spores were 4.6 μm long and 2.8 μm wide (based on TEM); they were monokaryotic and the polar filament was isofilar with 25 coils in a single rank in the posterior of the spore. The exospore was relatively thin with an irregular profile. Neither infection elicited an inflammatory response, although degenerate spores were observed within host cells, suggesting phagocytosis.

This new species was found to be heterosporous producing several types of binucleate spores in both larval and adult stages and an abortive octosporoblastic sporogony in adult ants. While microsporidia are widespread arthropod parasites, this description represents only the fifth species described from an ant host. Molecular analysis indicated that this new taxon is phylogenetically closely allied to the microsporidian family Caudosporidae, a group known to parasitize aquatic black fly larvae.

Sp., an Unusual Microsporidian Parasite of the Dungeness Crab, Cancer Magister ::: The microsporidium Nadelspora canceri n. g., n. sp., is described from the striated musculature of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) in Oregon, USA. The needle‐shaped spores were rounded anteriorly, tapered to a posterior point and measured 7.1–11.8 × 0.2–0.3 μm in fixed preparations. The extremely narrow spore diameter prevented observation of morphological details at the light microscopic level and ultrastructural details of mature spores were difficult to resolve. Meronts were not observed and the monokaryotic merozoites and sporonts were not contained within either parasitophorous or sporophorous vesicles. Sporonts were disporoblastic and gave rise to monokaryotic sporoblasts that became narrow and elongate as they developed into immature spores with a developing polar filament. The nucleus was not clearly resolved in mature spores and may have been surrounded by the lamellar polaroplast. The polar filament was of nearly uniform diameter throughout most of its length and ended abruptly about three‐fourths of the distance from the anterior end of the spore. Unusual spherical non‐membrane bound granules surrounded the polar filament in a spiral arrangement. The new microsporidium resembles members of the family Mrazekiidiae, but differs in lacking a diplokaryon at any stage. It is probably most closely related to Baculea daphniae from which it differs primarily by spore shape and size.

Plurinucleate Plasmodia with nuclei arranged as diplokarya divide, probably by plasmotomy, producing a small number of diplokaryotic merozoites. The number of merogonial cycles is unknown. Each diplokaryotic sporont yields eight monokaryotic sporoblasts in a thin‐walled, more or less fusiform sporophorous vesicle. A small number of multisporoblastic sporophorous vesicles were observed, in which a part of the sporoblasts were anomalous. The sporogony probably begins with a meiotic division. The mature spores are slightly pyriform. Fixed and stained spores measure 2.1‐2.4 × 3.7‐4.5 μm. The five‐layered spore wall is of the Napamichum type. The polar filament is anisofilar with seven to eight coils (142‐156 and 120 nm wide). The angle of tilt is 55‐65°. The polaroplast has an anterior lamellar and a posterior tubular part. The granular, tubular and crystal‐like inclusions of the episporontal space disappear more or less completely when the spores mature. The crystal‐like inclusions are prominent in haematoxylin staining, but not visible with the Giemsa technique.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae.

365,Nematocida displodere,"Discovery of a Natural Microsporidian Pathogen with a Broad Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans ::: Microbial pathogens often establish infection within particular niches of their host for replication. Determining how infection occurs preferentially in specific host tissues is a key aspect of understanding host-microbe interactions. Here, we describe the discovery of a natural microsporidian parasite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host.

Abstract The two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., is a tree-dwelling lady beetle endemic to parts of Europe, Central Asia and North America that is commercially available for aphid control in Europe and North America. Lady beetles host a wide variety of symbionts including parasitoids, viruses, eugregarines, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and microsporidia. Four species of microsporidia have been described from lady beetles, and an undescribed microsporidium was recently isolated from local populations of A. bipunctata in Nova Scotia, Canada. In a previous study, this pathogen prolonged the development of A. bipunctata larvae but had no effect on adult fecundity, longevity or sex ratios. The objective of this study was to formally describe the microsporidium by means of its ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Mature spores measured 4.25±0.09×1.82±0.03μm (SE, n=49, from micrographs) and fresh spores measured 6.10±0.06×3.01±0.05μm (±SE, n=60; range: 5.0–6.9×2.18–3.86μm). The polar filament was isofilar with 10–18 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. The lamellar polaroplast was not typically visible and spores contained a relatively small posterior vacuole. Both the flight muscles and fat body were heavily infected and a large number of spores were observed within and between the cells of these tissues. The ovaries, developing oocytes, spermatocytes and accessory glands within the testes, midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ileum, colon, and ventral nerve cord were also infected but not as heavily. Connective tissue near the cuticle and surrounding the trachea were lightly infected. The presence of spores in both the alimentary canal and ovaries (particularly within developing oocytes) suggests that the microsporidium can be transmitted per os (horizontally) and transovarially (vertically). Molecular analysis of the genome of the microsporidium described in this study was 97% similar to Nosema bombi and 96% similar to Nosema thomsoni, Nosema vespula and Nosema oulemae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in A. bipunctata be given the name Nosema adaliae sp.

Procamallanus elatensis is a common camallanid nematode infecting the digestive tract of siganid fishes in the Red Sea. During a recent survey (1993-1994) of parasites of fishes from the Red Sea, 69% of Siganus luridus (9/13) and 49% of Siganus rivulatus (38/78) were infected with P. Elatensis. Nosema aegypti was noted in most of the host tissues of one Nematode in different stages of development. Spores (1.5 to 2.5 μm long) were observed beneath the cuticle and in the musculature of the nematode. Both the polaroplast and diplokaryon spores are small for microsporidians. The schizonts are small, irregularly shaped cells with electron dense grains in their cytoplasm. Sporonts contain two elongated nuclei and mature spores are characterized by 9 to 10 coils of the polar filament. Only one nematode was infected with N. aegypti.

Although lacewings are known for their symbiotic association with yeasts and bacteria, there are few reports of microsporidia in these natural enemies. An undescribed microsporidium was found in Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) during the routine examination of specimens that were obtained from a commercial insectary for biological pest control. The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen by means of ultrastructure, molecular characterization and tissue pathology. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony and sporogony were not observed. Mature spores measured 3.49±0.10×1.52±0.05μm and had an isofilar polar filament with 8–10 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row, although double rows were also observed. Spores contained a lamellar polaroplast and a relatively small and inconspicuous polar vacuole was observed in the posterior region of about half of the spores that were examined. Tubular structures, similar in appearance to those in Nosema granulosis were observed in both sporonts and in spores. A cluster of small tubules was also observed in the posterior region of some spores. Microsporidian spores were observed in cells of the proventriculus, diverticulum and in epithelial cells of the posterior midgut. The Malpighian tubules, ileum, and rectum were heavily infected. Spores were also observed in the fat body, peripheral region of the ganglia, within and between the flight muscles, and beneath the cuticle. Although the tissues adjacent to the ovaries were heavily infected, microsporidian spores were not observed within the developing eggs. Pathogen transmission was not studied directly because it was difficult to maintain microsporidia-infected C. carnea in the laboratory. The presence of microsporidian spores in the alimentary canal suggests that the pathogen is transmitted per os and horizontal transmission may occur when infected larvae or adults are cannibalized by uninfected larvae. Molecular analysis of the microsporidian genome showed that the pathogen described in this study was 99% similar to Nosema bombycis, N. furnacalis, N. granulosis and N. spodopterae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in C. carnea be given the name Nosema chrysoperlae sp. Nov.",,,Europe (); North America ()

Its life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles that are similar to the general developmental cycles of the Nosema-like microsporidia and are indistinguishable from those of two Nosema spp. from Lymantria dispar. The primary cycle takes place in the midgut tissues and produces binucleate primary spores. The secondary developmental cycle takes place exclusively in the silk glands and produces binucleate environmental spores. N. chrysorrhoeae is specific to the browntail moth.

403,Nosema epilachnae,"Two New Species of Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) from the Mexican Bean Beetle Epilachna Varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) 1 , 2 ::: Two new species of the genus Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) are described from the Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and their life cycle stages studied by light and electron microscopy. Both species are monomorphic and disporous; they develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of host cells and the nuclei of all stages are diplokaryotic. The more virulent species produces systemic infections most extensively in the adipose tissue, muscles, and Malpighian tubules of larvae and also invades the reproductive tissues of adult beetles. During merogonic development, it forms chains of diplokaryotic meronts. The fine structure of the sporoblast nuclei shows clumped material in the pole of each nucleus opposite their common plane of apposition. Spores are straight to slightly curved and ovocylindrical in shape and they measure 5.3 ± 0.13 x 2.1 ± 0.03 μm. The less virulent species also invades most host tissues but does not develop in the midgut epithelium; the Malpighian tubules are the principal site of its development and it also invades the ovaries and testes of adult beetles. Merogony occurs exclusively as the result of binary fission of diplokaryotic meronts. The plasmalemma of the meronts is covered with a thin deposit of exospore material upon which are located closely packed tubules that encircle the body transversely. A thickened deposit of exospore material on the surface of the diplokaryotic sporonts later obscures these tubules. Other tubules occur free in the host cell cytoplasm or attached to the plasmalemma of meronts and sporonts. Secretory granules also occur free or in chains in the host cytoplasm and are probably produced from the surface of the sporoblasts. Sporoblasts also contain an unusual cup-shaped organelle associated with a dense body, which is apparently involved in the formation of the polar tube and its associated organelles in the anterior part of the spore. Spores are ellipsoidal to slightly pyriform and measure 4.7 ± 0.06 x 2.6 ± 0.03 μm.",,,

E. postvittana originates from Australia and was first detected in California in 2006; therefore, our aim was to identify and determine the origin of the Nosema isolate. We characterized the pathogenicity, transmission pathways, and ultrastructure of this new Nosema isolate. In addition, we sequenced fragments of commonly used genetic markers (ITS, SSU, and RPB1), and examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Nosema isolate and other microsporidian species commonly found in lepidopteran hosts. The pathogenicity of the Nosema isolate was investigated by infecting second instar larvae of E. postvittana. Larval and pupal survivorship were reduced by 7% and 13% respectively, and pupation occurred 1–2d later in infected individuals than in healthy individuals. Emerging infected females died 5d earlier than healthy females, and daily fecundity was 22% lower. Hatch rate also was 22% lower for eggs oviposited by infected females. Vertical transmission was confirmed; spores were present in 68% of egg masses and 100% of the surviving larvae from infected females. Ultrastructure images, together with sequences from selected genetic markers, confirmed the Nosema isolate to be a member of the Nosema fumiferanae species complex (Nosema fumiferanae postvittana subsp. n.).

The diplokaryotic nucleus is characterized by an achromatic line less than 1 mu-m in width which divides it through its centre. This characteristic does not occur in other species of Nosema and is unique to N. partelli. It occurs through all developmental stages from the diplokaryotic sporoblast to the encysting spores. Sporogony is heralded by spindle-shaped diplokaryotic sporoblasts. Diplokaryotic sporonts decrease in size, their nuclei tend to become smaller and pyknotic, after which visible detail is lost following encystment.","South Africa (Brits and Warmbaths Districts, Transvaal)",South Africa (Brits and Warmbaths Districts | Oos-Transvaal),Diplokaryotic ()

(Microsporidia, Nosematidae) is described from Podocotyloides magnatestis (Trematoda: Opecoelidae), a parasite of the fish Parapristipoma octolineatum (Teleostei) in the Atlantic Ocean. Electron microscopy reveals that all the stages of the cycle (merogony and sporogony) are diplokaryotic and in direct contact with the cytoplasm of host cells. There is no sporophorous vesicle (pansporoblast). The earliest stages observed are meronts, which have a simple plasmic membrane. Their cytoplasm is granular, rich in ribosomes and contains some sacculi of endoplasmic reticulum. They divide by binary fission into diplokaryotic sporonts. The sporonts have a thick electron-dense wall. Their diplokaryon is slightly less electron-dense than the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of more advanced sporonts has numerous electron-lucent vesicles. Sporonts with two diplokarya divide by binary fission into diplokaryotic sporoblasts. The older sporoblasts are irregular or elongate and the polar filament is in formation. Their cytoplasm is denser, with ribosomes and lamellae of granular endoplasmic reticulum. The sporoblasts evolve into spores. The mature spores are broadly oval and measure 3.6 (3.1–4.0) × 2.58 (1.8–3.3) μm. Their wall is 100–300 nm thick. The polar tube is isofilar with 11–16 coils, 130–155 nm in diameter and arranged in many layers in the centre of the spore.

Collected in Portugal ::: A microsporidium Nosema portugal n. sp. was isolated from gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L, collected near Lisbon, Portugal, in 1985. The Life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles, a primary and a secondary cycle. The primary cycle occurs in midgut epithelial cells, where primary spores are produced within 48 h. The primary spores immediately extrude their polar filaments, presumably to infect other cells. In the target tissues (salivary glands and fat body) the secondary development cycle is followed by the formation of environmental spores. Primary spores were also sometimes present in target tissues. Fresh unfixed and unstained primary spores have a large posterior vacuole and measured 4.8 x 2.7 mu m. Ultrastructurally, they have 5-8 polar filament coils, a large posterior vacuole, abundant endoplasmic reticulum, and were binucleate. Mature unfixed and unstained environmental spores were highly refractive and the posterior vacuole and nuclei could not be seen through the spore coat. Fresh environmental spores measured 4.5 x 1.9 mu m. Ultrastructurally, environmental spores were binucleate, with a typical polaroplast, 10-11 isofilar polar filament coils, and a series of 4-6 thin polar filament-like tubules situated at the posterior end of the row of typical polar filament coils.

A sporont gave rise to two spores, and there was no sporophorous vesicle. This microsporidium produced two types of spores, those with 2 to 3 coils and those with 11 to 12 coils of the polar tube during development in Antheraea eucalypti cells. Larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, were not infected by the microsporidium when the spores were administered perorally. Spores of the predominant type, with 11 to 12 polar tube coils, were longer and narrower than those of the corresponding spores of Nosema bombycis. Furthermore they did not react with latex particles, which had been sensitized with a monoclonal antibody against spores of N. bombycis, another isolate of Nosema (M11) or an isolate of Vairimorpha (M12). The new isolate is distinct from N. bombycis and is the second species to be isolated from S. depravata.","Japan (Sayama city, Saitama)",Japan (Sayama city | Saitama),

The infection was found in the gut wall, silk glands, and fat body and was probably generalized but appeared to be of low pathogenicity. Merogony and sporogony were by binary fission of diplokaryotic stages. Fresh spores were elongate, slightly pointed at the anterior end, and measured 4.7 x 2.0 microm. Ultrastructural features of special interest were 20-nm tubules connecting the surface of sporonts with host cell cytoplasm and, in the spores, a deeply domed polar sac, polaroplast consisting of closely packed longitudinally arranged membranes and loosely packed horizontally arranged membranes, and 10.5-14 coils of the polar tube in a single rank. The 16S rRNA genes of N. tyriae and Nosema bombycis from silkworms, Bombyx mori, differed by only six nucleotides and N. tyriae spores gave a moderately positive reaction with a monoclonal antibody raised to N. bombycis. N. tyriae was infective to B. mori but was less virulent than N. bombycis. However, no amplification product was obtained by PCR using N. tyriae DNA and primers considered to be specific for N. bombycis. Also, the spores of the two species are of entirely different shapes. A second diplokaryotic microsporidium, Nosema sp., found as a light infection in only one of the larvae had much smaller developmental stages and spores measuring 3.8 x 2.0 microm (fixed). Ultrastructurally it was distinguished by an abundance of dense membranes in cytoplasmic vesicles in both meronts and sporonts. Spores with up to 15 coils of the polar tube in irregular clusters or with about 12 coils in a single rank were observed in the tissues fixed from the one larva infected with this parasite. As this larva had been kept with N. tyriae-infected larvae for a few days before examination, it is possible that the two types of spores resulted from a double infection.",United Kingdom,United Kingdom (),

The small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequence of CmM2 was obtained by PCR amplification and sequencing, the phylogenetic tree based on SSU rRNA sequences had been constructed, and the similarity and genetic distance of SSU rRNA sequences were analyzed, showed that CmM2 was grouped in the Nosema clade. The 50% infectious concentration of CmM2 to Bombyx mori is 4.72 × 104 spores ml−1, and the germinative infection rate is 12.33%.

485,Nosema varivestis,"Two New Species of Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) from the Mexican Bean Beetle Epilachna Varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) 1 , 2 ::: Two new species of the genus Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) are described from the Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and their life cycle stages studied by light and electron microscopy. Both species are monomorphic and disporous; they develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of host cells and the nuclei of all stages are diplokaryotic. The more virulent species produces systemic infections most extensively in the adipose tissue, muscles, and Malpighian tubules of larvae and also invades the reproductive tissues of adult beetles. During merogonic development, it forms chains of diplokaryotic meronts. The fine structure of the sporoblast nuclei shows clumped material in the pole of each nucleus opposite their common plane of apposition. Spores are straight to slightly curved and ovocylindrical in shape and they measure 5.3 ± 0.13 x 2.1 ± 0.03 μm. The less virulent species also invades most host tissues but does not develop in the midgut epithelium; the Malpighian tubules are the principal site of its development and it also invades the ovaries and testes of adult beetles. Merogony occurs exclusively as the result of binary fission of diplokaryotic meronts. The plasmalemma of the meronts is covered with a thin deposit of exospore material upon which are located closely packed tubules that encircle the body transversely. A thickened deposit of exospore material on the surface of the diplokaryotic sporonts later obscures these tubules. Other tubules occur free in the host cell cytoplasm or attached to the plasmalemma of meronts and sporonts. Secretory granules also occur free or in chains in the host cytoplasm and are probably produced from the surface of the sporoblasts. Sporoblasts also contain an unusual cup-shaped organelle associated with a dense body, which is apparently involved in the formation of the polar tube and its associated organelles in the anterior part of the spore. Spores are ellipsoidal to slightly pyriform and measure 4.7 ± 0.06 x 2.6 ± 0.03 μm.",,,

And a microsporidian Nosema ptinidorum n. sp. Both parasites invade the fat body of adults of host-animals. The larvae remained free from infection. The two new pathogens are described and pictured. This is the first report on coccidian and microsporidian parasites found in stored product pests of the Family Ptinidae, Coleoptera.Three species of microsporidia from a population of winter moths, Operophtera brumata (L.), were examined by light microscopy. Pleistophora operophterae (Canning, 1960) is redescribed. The stages with one or two nuclei which were originally termed presporonts are now interpreted as fragments of disrupted vacuolated sporonts or prematuraly separated sporoblasts. The range of spore numbers within sporophorous vesicles is modified to 4 to c.60, rather than 10 to c.100. This species cannot be retained in the genus Pleistophora Gurley, 1893, redefined by Canning & Nicholas (1980), but ultrastructural studies are required before taxonomic reassignment is attempted. Nosema operophterae Canning, 1960 is also redescribed. Merogony consists mainly of binary fission of binucleate and tetranucleate stages but large irregular-shaped multinucleate meronts were also present. Ribbon-shaped sporonts with two, four or eight linearly-spaced nuclei give rise, via binucleate segments, to chains of uninucleate sporoblasts. The species is transferred to a new genus Orthosoma n.g. as Orthosoma operophterae (Canning, 1960) since its isolated nuclei and polysporoblastic sporogony are not characteristic of the genus Nosema Nägeli, 1857. The third species Nosema operophterae Purrini & Skatulla, 1979 is renamed N. wistmansi nom.nov. because the name given by Purrini & Skatulla was preoccupied and is now a synonym of O. operophterae. Details of the developmental stages of N. wistmansi are given, which show that it is typical of the genus Nosema, with nuclei in diplokaryon arrangement and with disporoblastic sporogony.

Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool located near the village of Troitskoe, Novosibirsk region, Western Siberia) Russia",Russia (pool located near the village of Troitskoe | Novosibirsk region | Siberia),Russia (Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk | Siberia)
491,Nucleophaga terricolae,"Molecular identification of Nucleophaga terricolae sp. nov. (Rozellomycota), and new insights on the origin of the Microsporidia ::: Microsporidia are widespread endoparasites of animals, including humans. They are characterized by highly modified morphological and genetic features that cause difficulties in elucidating their enigmatic origin and evolution. Recent advances, however, indicate that the Microsporidia have emerged from the Rozellomycota, forming together either the most basal lineage of the Fungi or its closer relative. The Rozellomycota comprise a huge diversity of uncultured environmental clones, with a very few known species endoparasitic of algae and water moulds, like the chytrid-like Rozella, and of free-living amoebae, like Nucleophaga and the microsporidia-like Paramicrosporidium. A possible ancestral microsporidium, Mitosporidium, has recently been described from the water flea Daphnia, since the phylogenomic reconstruction showed that it branches to the root of the microsporidian tree, while the genome analysis revealed a fungal-like nuclear genome and the persistence of a mitochondrial genome. Here we report the 18S rDNA molecular phylogeny of an additional microsporidium-like endoparasite of amoebae, which has a developmental cycle almost identical to that of Nucleophaga amoebae. Our results show that the endoparasite is closely related to N. amoebae, forming a distinct species, for which we propose the name Nucleophaga terricolae. Furthermore, the Nucleophaga lineage is recovered as sister to the Microsporidia while Mitosporidium turns out to be member of a well-supported group of environmental clones. These results raise the question about the actual ancestry of the Microsporidia within the Rozellomycota. A precise and robust phylogeny will require further comparative genomic studies of these various strains, and should also consider the primitive microsporidia, for which genetic data are still lacking, because all these organisms are essentially morphologically similar.",,,

The ultrastructure of this new species is presented together with the first molecular characterization for a microsporidium of mites. All stages of this new microsporidium are haplokaryotic and develop in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm. Sporogony is disporoblastic and spores are formed in eggs, immature stages, and adults of M. occidentalis. There are two morphological classes of spores, one with a short polar filament (3–5 coils) that measured m and one with a longer polar filament (8–9 coils) that measured m. Horizontal transmission of this new species occurs by cannibalism of eggs and other stages and perhaps involves the spores with the long polar filament. Spores with the short polar filament may play a role in autoinfection and vertical (transovarial) transmission that is highly efficient in transferring the microsporidium from adults to progeny. Analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA indicated that this species from M. occidentalis is most closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade of microsporidia.

(Microspora, Ordosporidae fam. nov.), a new microsporidian parasite of Daphnia magna (Crustacea, Cladocera) ::: The new microsporidium Ordospora colligata gen. et sp. n. is described with emphasis on the ultrastructural characteristics. The parasite, which is superficially similar to Glugoides intestinalis (Chatton, 1907), invades the gut epithelium of Daphnia magna, where the complete development takes place in a host cell-derived parasitophorous vacuole. Merogonial and sporogonial stages occur together in the vacuole, with presporal stages at the periphery, mature spores aggregated in the centre. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial plasmodia are initially rounded, later elongated, and they give rise to four merozoites. The bouts of merogony are unknown. The sporont produces two sporoblast mother cells, which often remain coupled. Each cell generates a chain of four sporoblasts. Sporophorous vesicles are not produced. Mature spores are pyriform with a pointed anterior pole and with an obliquely positioned posterior vacuole. Unfixed spores measure 1.33-2.29 x 2.32-3.69 μm. The exospore is uniform, about 11 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar, 82-85 nm wide, making 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore.

511,Ovipleistophora arlo,"Evidence for trophic transfer of Inodosporus octospora and Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp. (Microsporidia) between crustacean and fish hosts ::: Within aquatic habitats, the hyper-abundant Order Crustacea appear to be the predominant host group for members of the Phylum Microsporidia. The musculature, a common site of infection, provides access to biochemical (carbohydrate-rich) and physiological (mitochondria-rich) conditions conducive to prolific parasite replication and maturation. The significant proportion of body plan devoted to skeletal musculature in Crustacea provides the location for a highly efficient intracellular parasite factory. In this study, we utilize histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic evidence to describe a previously known (Inodosporus octospora) and novel (Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp.) microsporidian parasites infecting the musculature of the common prawn (Palaemon serratus) from the same site, at the same time of year. Despite similar clinical signs of infection, both parasites are otherwise distinct in terms of pathogenesis, morphology and phylogeny. Based upon partial subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) sequence, we show that that I. octospora may be identical to a Kabatana sp. previously described infecting two-spot goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) in Europe, or at least that Inodosporus and Kabatana genera are synonyms. In addition, SSU rDNA sequence for O. arlo places it within a distinct clade containing Ovipleistophora mirandellae and Ovipleistophora ovariae, both infecting the oocytes of freshwater fish in Europe. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for trophic-transfer between crustacean and fish hosts for two different microsporidians within clade 5 of the phylum. Furthermore, it demonstrates that morphologically and phylogenetically distinct microsporidians can infect the same tissues of the same host species to impart clinical signs which mimic infection with the other.","(Carrick Roads, Fal Estuary) Cornwall",Cornwall (Fal Estuary | Carrick Roads),Europe ()

However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild.

All studied caddis fly microsporidia form a closely related group. Their developmental stages in trichopteran hosts are restricted to fat body cells and oenocytes and have isolated nuclei. In late merogony, uninucleate meronts and binucleate plasmodia are formed. In sporogony a sporogonial plasmodium with four nuclei gives rise by rosette-like budding to four sporoblasts within a non-persistent sporophorous vesicle. Sporoblasts mature into pyriform to lageniform spores. The shape and size of spores, the number of polar filament coils, the structure of the polaroplast and of the exospore, together with morphometric characters present a set of markers unique for respective species.

Formation of a multinucleate meront (>12 nuclei observed) preceded thickening and invagination of the plasmodial membrane, and in many cases, formation of spore extrusion precursors (polar filaments, anchoring disk) prior to complete separation of pre-sporoblasts from the sporogonial plasmodium. This developmental feature is intermediate between the Enterocytozoonidae (formation of spore extrusion precursors within the sporont plasmodium) and all other Microsporidia (formation of spore extrusion precursors after separation of sporont from the sporont plasmodium). SSU rRNA-based gene phylogenies place P. carcini within microsporidian Clade IV, between the Enterocytozoonidae and the so-called Enterocytospora-clade, which includes Enterocytospora artemiae and Globulispora mitoportans. Both of these groups contain gut-infecting microsporidians of aquatic invertebrates, fish and humans. According to morphological and phylogenetic characters, we propose that P. carcini occupies a basal position to the Enterocytozoonidae. We discuss the discovery of this parasite from a taxonomic perspective and consider its origins and presence within a high profile invasive host on the Atlantic Canadian coastline.",Canada (Nova Scotia),Canada (Nova Scotia),Canada ()

524,Paranucleospora theridion,"Paranucleospora theridion n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporidia, Enterocytozoonidae) with a Life Cycle in the Salmon Louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis, Copepoda) and Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) ::: ABSTRACT . Paranucleospora theridion n. gen, n. sp., infecting both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and its copepod parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis is described. The microsporidian exhibits nuclei in diplokaryotic arrangement during all known life-cycle stages in salmon, but only in the merogonal stages and early sporogonal stage in salmon lice. All developmental stages of P. theridion are in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. In salmon, two developmental cycles were observed, producing spores in the cytoplasm of phagocytes or epidermal cells (Cycle-I) and in the nuclei of epidermal cells (Cycle-II), respectively. Cycle-I spores are small and thin walled with a short polar tube, and are believed to be autoinfective. The larger oval intranuclear Cycle-II spores have a thick endospore and a longer polar tube, and are probably responsible for transmission from salmon to L. salmonis. Parasite development in the salmon louse occurs in several different cell types that may be extremely hypertrophied due to P. theridion proliferation. Diplokaryotic merogony precedes monokaryotic sporogony. The rounded spores produced are comparable to the intranuclear spores in the salmon in most aspects, and likely transmit the infection to salmon. Phylogenetic analysis of P. theridion partial rDNA sequences place the parasite in a position between Nucleospora salmonis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based on characteristics of the morphology, unique development involving a vertebrate fish as well as a crustacean ectoparasite host, and the results of the phylogenetic analyses it is suggested that P. theridion should be given status as a new species in a new genus.",Norway,Norway (),Diplokaryotic ()

The larvae were maintained under laboratory conditions in salt concentrations of 10 g/l and 20 g/l of water. Daily recordings of the mortality of the larvae were made and the dates of change of instar were noted. Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages. The mature spores found in the intestines of infected larvae were barrel shaped and measured approximately 2.6 x 2.4 mm. The exospore has a collar shaped prolongation at the posterior end of the spore. The spores are uninuclear with a posterior vacuole. The polar filament is anisofilar with nine rings, five with a diameter of 58 nm each and four with a diameter of 23 nm each. The polarplast is lamellate, and more tightly packed in the apical region. The reduction of the survival of A. aquasalis larvae infected with the microsporidia, and the increase in the development time suggest that this parasite might have a potential as a biological control of this pest. The microsporidium described here has similar characteristics to that of the genus Parathelohania. I suggest that the microsporidium found in A. aquasalis represents a new species and I propose the name Parathelohania aquasalensis.

Recently a microsporidium infection was discovered in Anopheles superpictus (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, in Iran. The responsible agent belonged to the genus Parathelohania (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae). This study has been carried out to identify its identity at the species level. Fresh infected larvae were collected from the type locality, Kiar district, in Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari province, at the central western of Iran. Superficial and the internal ultrastructure of the recovered spores were explored by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Molecular techniques were also employed to amplify parts of its ssu rDNA. The obtained data were compared with the available information of congener species and other closely related microsporidia to elucidate evolutionary relationship. A small apical depression and two posterolateral ridges extending backward from a pear shaped anterior body mass were notable under scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed 2 broad and 3–4 narrow coils in the either side of spores, respectively. The sequence of a 1062 nucleotide fragment of ssu rDNA was determined by means of PCR technique. This study indicates that the microsporidium infecting An. superpictus differs from other previously described species in the genus Parathelohania. It means that the microsporidium infecting An. superpictus is a new species and hereby it is called Parathelohania iranica.

The spores of Pe. moriokae had an average size of 1.0 × 3.8 µm and 1.3 × 3.2 µm in the intestine and hypodermis, respectively, and electron microscopy revealed that they exhibited distinguishing features with morphological diversity in the hypodermis. Isolated spores were able to infect a reference strain of O. tipulae (CEW1) through horizontal transmission but not the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon infection, the spores were first observed in the hypodermis and then in the intestine the following day, suggesting a unique infectious route among nematode-infective microsporidia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis grouped this new species with the recently identified nematode-infective parasites Enteropsectra and Pancytospora forming a monophyletic sister clade to Orthosomella in clade IV, which also includes human pathogens such as Enterocytozoon and Vittaforma.

Merogony is diplokaryotic. Each diplokaryon of the merogonial plasmodium matures to a sporont diplokaryon, and the plasmodium thus matures into a sporogonial plasmodium which divides by rosette-like budding. The number of lobes equals the number of diplokarya. Sporogony comprises meiotic and mitotic divisions, and each diplokaryon yields a chain of eight sporoblasts. A sporophorous vesicle and a parasitophorous vacuole enclose the total amount of spores produced by the plasmodium. The monokaryotic spores are rod-shaped, c. 1 × 14 μm in living condition. The thin spore wall has a layered exospore with an internal double-layer. The polaroplast has an anterior lamellar and a posterior sac-like part.

Generally, the infection was increased during winter 63.8% (86 out of 135) and fall to 18.9% (17 out of 90) in summer. Light microscopic study revealed that xenomas were encapsulated by a fibrous layer encircling numerous sporophorous vesicles filled with mature spores measuring 1.7 ± 0.6 (1.5–2.7 μm) × 1.5 ± 0.3 μm (1.2–1.8 μm) in size. Ultrastructural microscopic study showed the presence of smooth membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forming a thick, amorphous coat surrounding various developmental stages of the parasite. The various recognizable stages of the parasite were uninuclear, binucleated, and multinucleated meronts followed by detachment of the plasmalemma of the sporont from the sporophorous vesicle producing sporoblasts. Mature spores consist of a spore coat and spore contents. The spore contents consist of the uninucleated sporoplasm and a posterior vacuole located at the posterior end.

All of the development stages of this microsporidian are monokaryotic. The meronts are initially uninucleate and bounded by a plasmalemma. Towards the end of merogony, meronts are multinucleate plasmodia with a well-defined surface coat. Sporogony is polysporous, with multinucleate sporonts, which likewise have a well-defined surface coat (about 130 nm thick), dividing by plasmotomy to give rise to uninucleate sporoblasts. The polar tube is isofilar and consists of 8-9 turns in the posterior half of spore. The polaroplast is made up of an anterior lamellar part and a posterior vesicular part.","East Atlantic Ocean (Coastal waters of Galicia, Northwest Spain)",Mystic Island (Coastal waters of Galicia | Pain de Sucre),

559,Pleistophora pagri,"Ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetics of a new isolate of Pleistophora pagri sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Pleistophoridae) from Pagrus pagrus in Egypt ::: The spore morphology and molecular systematic of a new microsporidian which was isolated from the common sea bream Pagrus pagrus (F: Sparidae Linnaeus, 1758) from the Red Sea, Egypt have been studied. Fifty-six out of 300 (18.7 %) of this fish were infected with microsporidian parasites. The infection was appeared as whitish, ellipsoid, round, or elongated nodules embedded in the epithelial lining of the peritoneum and also in the intestinal epithelium. Light microscopic study revealed that nodules were encapsulated by a fibrous layer encircling numerous mature spores measuring 1.7 ± 0.6 (1.5–2.7 μm) × 1.5 ± 0.3 μm (1.2–1.8 μm) in size. Ultrastructure of spores was characteristic for the genus Pleistophora: dimorphic, uninucleate spores (each spore possesses three to five polar filament coils) and a posterior vacuole. Also, the early recognizable stages of the parasite within nodules include uninucleated, binucleated, and multinucleated meronts followed by detachment of the plasmalemma of the sporont producing sporoblasts which mature to spores that consist of a spore coat and spore contents. Also, we analyzed the small subunit ribosomal gene (SSUrDNA) using PCR and sequencing specimens from the marine populations of P. pagrus fish from the Red Sea. From blast searches, sequence analysis, and phylogenetic analysis, we did not find corresponding GenBank entries to our species. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences showed that the sequence of our microsporidium was most similar to five Pleistophora species with degrees of identity (>91.5 %). It was most similar (97.8 % identity) to that of Pleistophora hyphessobryconis (account no.

562,Pleistophora ronneafiei,"Ultrastructure and Development of Pleistophora ronneafiei n. sp., a Microsporidium (Protista) in the Skeletal Muscle of an Immune-Compromised Individual ::: ABSTRACT. This report provides a detailed ultrastructural study of the life cycle, including proliferative and sporogonic developmental stages, of the first Pleistophora species (microsporidium) obtained from an immune-incompetent patient. In 1985, the organism obtained from a muscle biopsy was initially identified as belonging to the genus Pleistophora, based on spore morphology and its location in a sporophorous vesicle. Since that initial report, at least two new microsporidial genera, Trachipleistophora and Brachiola, have been reported to infect the muscle tissue of immunologically compromised patients. Because Trachipleistophora development is similar to Pleistophora, and as Pleistophora was only known to occur in cold-blooded hosts, the question of the proper classification of this microsporidium arose. The information acquired in this study makes it possible to compare Pleistophora sp. (Ledford et al. 1985) to the known human infections and properly determine its correct taxonomic position. Our ultrastructural data have revealed the formation of multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia, a developmental characteristic of the genus Pleistophora and not Trachipleistophora. A comparison with other species of the genus supports the establishment of a new species. This parasite is given the name Pleistophora ronneafiei n. sp.",USA (Florida),United States (Florida),

This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas containing variable number of spores, reaching up to ~0.4 mm in diameter. The mature spores, pyriformin shape, with slightly round ends, measured 3.4 ± 0.5 μm long and 1.9 ± 0.3 μm wide (n = 50) and showed characteristics typical of Microsporidia. The average thickness of the spore wall was 100 (96–108) nm (n = 50), and the spore wall was composed of two layers, a thin, electron-dense exospore and a thick electron-transparent endospore. The exospore was surrounded by a thin, irregular layer of granular material. The anchoring disc was mushroom-like, located in the apical region of the spore in an eccentric position relative to the spore axis, rendering bilateral asymmetry to the spore. The anterior part of the polar filament (PF) (manubrium) measured approximately 125 (122–128) nm thick (n = 30), and the angle of tilt between the anterior PF and the spore axis was ~45°; the posterior part was packed in 8–9 coils.

A conspicuous symptom of the infection was progressive white opacity associated with the musculature. Although neither bacteria nor viruses were detected in routine diagnostic tests, apparently degenerated microsporidian cells or spores were frequently observed in wet smears of the musculature from diseased prawns. Histological observations also revealed characteristics typical of microsporidian infection throughout the host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed multiple life stages of a microsporidian parasite within the cytoplasm of host muscle cells. In addition, partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was obtained by a nested PCR using microsporidian specific primers. A consensus sequence was then deposited in GenBank (accession no. KU307278) and subjected to a general BLASTn search that yielded hits only for microsporidian sequence records. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate was most similar to the fish microsporidian clade containing the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Teramicra. The highest sequence identity, 87%, was with Potaspora spp. Based on histological, ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic data, we erected a new species, Potaspora macrobrachium for the novel microsporidium.

However, many of these pathogens are known only from molecular-based studies. We provide ultrastructural data supported by molecular phylogeny for a common microsporidium infecting the Daphnia longispina complex, important planktonic filter-feeders in reservoirs and ponds in the temperate Holarctic region. This parasite, previously characterized only by molecular means, infects adipose cells around the Daphnia midgut and eventually fills the centre of the host body with ovoid-shaped spores. A new microsporidian genus and species belonging to the Agglomeratidae superclade is described as Pseudoberwaldia daphniae gen. et sp. nov. Molecular data indicate its widespread presence in Central European reservoirs (reported as isolate “MIC1”) but also in Swedish coastal rockpools (“Ängskärs-klubben”). The most closely related lineage was reported from a caddisfly larva; we thus speculate that this taxon may have an insect secondary host in its life cycle.

The parasite elicits formation of spherical xenomas of up to 1.2 mm in diameter containing all observed life stages from early merogonal plasmodia to mature spores contained within the cytoplasm of host hepatocytes. Merogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host cytoplasm and contained up to 20 visible nuclei. Plasmotomy of the multinucleate plasmodium led to formation of uninucleate cells in which the nucleus underwent further division to form bi-nucleate presporonts, sporonts (defined by cells with a thickened endospore) and eventually sporoblasts (containing pre-cursors of the spore extrusion apparatus). Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 2.3 ± 0.19 μm long and 1.3 ± 0.10 μm wide. Spores possessed a bipartite polaroplast and 5–6 coils of a polar filament, in a single rank. The obtained partial SSU rRNA gene sequence, 1383 bp in length, did not match any of microsporidia available in GenBank. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated a new taxon branching with Kabatana rondoni, a parasite infecting the skeletal muscle of Gymnorhamphichthys rondoni from the Amazon River. Due to different host and tissue tropism, the novel taxon did not fit the diagnostic criteria for the genus Kabatana.

The microsporidium produces xenomas within the spinal cord and hindbrain of fish, and xenomas contained sporophorous vesicles with up to 16 spores. Sporoblasts and presporoblast stages (probably sporonts) are found occasionally in small aggregates dispersed randomly throughout xenomas. It clustered in the ""Ichthyosporidium group"" along with other fish microsporidian genera based on rDNA sequence analysis.

Giemsa-stained mature spores are oval in shape and measured 3.40 ± 0.37 μm in length and 1.63 ± 0.20 μm in width. These uninucleate spores have an isofilar polar filament with 11 turns. The spore wall was trilaminar (75 to 115 nm) with a rugose, electron-dense exospore (34 to 45 nm) and a thickened, electron-lucent endospore (65 to 80 nm) overlaying the plasmalemma. Morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular features indicate that the described microsporidium is dissimilar to all known microsporidian taxa and confirm that it has different taxonomic characters than other microsporidia infecting X. luteola and is named here as Rugispora istanbulensis n. gen., n. sp.",(Istanbul) Turkey,Turkey (İstanbul),Turkey (Istanbul); Brazil (Fazenda N.

580,Schroedera airthreyi,"Development and Molecular Characterisation of the Microsporidian Schroedera airthreyi n. sp. in a Freshwater Bryozoan Plumatella sp. (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata) ::: Abstract. The development of a new species of microsporidian, infecting a freshwater Plumatellid bryozoan, is described. The small-subunit rDNA, internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and partial large-subunit rDNA genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the parasite clustered with Schroedera plumatellae. However, while there were morphological affinities with this species, significant differences were also observed. The infection initially appeared as a roughening of the peritoneum lining the metacoelom of the bryozoan. This roughening resolved into meront-infected syncytia, composed of interconnected cells of the body wall that detached to float in the coleomic cavity. Spores were observed to develop within these syncytia. All stages of development were diplokaryotic in contrast to S. plumatellae, which has a distinct monokaryotic merogony preceding sporogony. The infection was pathogenic to the host. Direct bryozoan–bryozoan transmission was not observed. We propose to name the microsporidian Schroedera aithreyi n. sp.",Scotland,Scotland (),

The development of the infection is described both at the light and ultrastructural level. The infection induces the formation of hyperplastic testes within the bryozoan host from which cord-like xenomas form. Development of diplokaryotic sporonts is preceded by haplophasic schizogony. Sporogony forms diplokaryotic spores. The spores formed within the xenomas are oval, tapering to one end and were 7.2 ± 0.3 μm by 5.0 ± 0.3 μm with 22-23 turns of the polar filament. Sporogony occurred within the hyaloplasm with the exospore developing into two distinct layers.

582,Sporanauta perivermis,"Microsporidian Infection in a Free-Living Marine Nematode ::: Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites. Although nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse animal groups, the only confirmed report of microsporidian infection was that of the “nematode killer” (Nematocida parisii). N. parisii was isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis sp. and causes an acute and lethal intestinal infection in a lab strain of Caenorhabditis elegans. We set out to characterize a microsporidian infection in a wild nematode to determine whether the infection pattern of N. parisii in the lab is typical of microsporidian infections in nematodes. We describe a novel microsporidian species named Sporanauta perivermis (marine spore of roundworms) and characterize its infection in its natural host, the free-living marine nematode Odontophora rectangula. S. perivermis is not closely related to N. parisii and differs strikingly in all aspects of infection. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the infection was localized in the hypodermal and muscle tissues only and did not involve the intestines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed infection in the muscle and hypodermis, and surprisingly, it also revealed that the parasite infects O. rectangula eggs, suggesting a vertical mode of transmission. Our observations highlight the importance of studying parasites in their natural hosts and indicate that not all nematode-infecting microsporidia are “nematode killers”; instead, microsporidiosis can be more versatile and chronic in the wild.","(Tsawwassen, British Columbia) Canada",Canada (British Columbia | Tsawwassen),

Abstract A new genus and species of Microsporidia, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. is described from Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (Theobald) and Ochlerotatus hatorii (Yamada) based on light microscope and ultrastructural morphology, developmental features, transmission cycles and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). The microsporidium is both vertically and horizontally transmitted, exhibits dimorphic development alternating between diplokaryotic and monokaryotic stages and produces two morphologically distinct spores, one in larvae and another in adult females. Horizontal transmission of infection to larval mosquitoes occurs via direct oral ingestion of uninucleate spores that are produced in vertically-infected larval hosts. Development in horizontally-infected hosts is diplokaryotic following karyokinesis of uninucleate schizonts and binary fission to produce small (4.3μm×2.0μm) membrane free, ovoid, binucleate spores that are confined to adult female reproductive tissues (ovariole sheath and oviducts). Vertical transmission of the microsporidium from adult females to larval progeny takes place via surface contamination of the egg (transovum). Microsporidian development in vertically-infected larvae is haplophasic with unpaired nuclei throughout, producing rosette-shaped sporogonial plasmodia contained within a thin non-persistent sporophorous vesicle and culminating in the formation of membrane free, uninucleate, conical spores (7.0μm×2.8μm). Development is confined to host fat body tissue which appears as swollen white masses in the thorax and selected segments of the abdomen causing larvae to appear abnormally distorted and results in death during the third and fourth instar stages. The SSU rDNA sequences obtained from the two morphologically identical microsporidia isolated from Oc. j. japonicus and Oc. hatorii were nearly identical and unique when compared with GenBank entries of all other mosquito-parasitic species. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and bootstrap analyses using the Neighbor Joining search parameter yielded similar typologies. In each case, the novel microsporidium was the sister group to the clade containing Parathelohania species from Anopheles mosquitoes and the monotypic Novothelohania ovalae from Ochlerotatus caspius showing approximately 10–13% sequence divergence to those two genera providing strong support for establishment as a separate genus.",,,

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 16–32 spores. The spores are rod-shaped, 1.3–1.4 × 3.7–4.2 μm in living condition. The spore wall has a 34–40 nm thick, layered exospore, with a median layer resembling a unit membrane. The endospore is thicker than the exospore. The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, where the posterior lamellae are the widest. The isofilar, 128–149 nm thick polar filament is arranged in 9–10 coils in a single layer close to the spore wall in the posterior 2/3 of the spore. The angle of tilt is c. 45°. The transversely sectioned polar filament has distinct concentrical layers of variable thickness and electron density. Sporophorous vesicles are ellipsoid and fragile. The thin electron-dense envelope is initiated as narrow tubulus-like promordia, appearing when the nucleus of the sporont has divided once. The episporontal space of vesicles with sporogonial plasmodia is devoid of inclusions. Vesicles with sporoblasts and spores have tubular exospore-derived inclusions of two dimensions.

(Coleoptera: Helodidae) ::: A new species of the uncommon microsporidian genus Telomyxa (Microspora: Telomyxidae) has been found parasitizing the larval fat body of the semiaquatic beetle, Ora texana. In this species, the sporogonic sequence results in the formation of sporocysts measuring 7.7 times 6.5 μm that contain two crested uninucleate spores (averaging 5.7 times 2.2 μm). The spores are essentially oblong/ovate, tapering toward the anterior end and remaining bound together after sporogony by a persistent accessory membrane or sporocyst. The two spores in the sporocyst are produced by an unusual morphogenetic sequence in which, after one mitosis, the binucleate sporont elongates, forming two lobes that fold toward one another and cleave along a central plane, forming two parallel sporoblasts. The general ultrastructural features of this process are described, and diagnostic characters of this new species of Telomyxa are presented.",U.S.A.,United States (),

Sporulation stages were studied with the light and the electron microscope. Earliest stages were small and apparently uninucleate. Next were small diplokaryotic cells that possibly arose by fusion of the former. These enlarged and underwent sporogony. Sporogony was a series of three binary divisions, each producing unikaryotic cells. There was no sporogonial plasmodium. The spore was ovoid, 4.8 × 3.1 μm (stained), with a large crescentic nucleus and rounded posterior vacuole. The polar filament was isofilar, doubly coiled, with about 10 turns. This species closely resembles the type T. giardi Henneguy.

594,Thelohania capillata,"Thelohania Capillata n. Sp. (Microspora, Thelohaniidae) — An Ultrastructural Study with Remarks on the Taxonomy of the Genus Thelohania Henneguy, 1892 ::: Thelohania capillata sp. nov. is described from larvae of the blackfly Odagmia ornata (MEIGEN, 1818), collected in a small stream in the south of Sweden, Infection was restricted to the adipose tissue, which was transformed into a syncytial xenoma. The earliest stage observed was diplo- karyotic merozoites, which mature directly into diplokaryotic sporonts. The first division of the sporont is a meiosis, identified by the occurrence of synaptonemal complexes, and it is usually followed by a mitotical division, resulting in a plasmodium with 8 single nuclei. The cytoplasm is further divided into 8 lobes which finally give rise to 8 rounded sporoblasts. Each sporoblast matures into a barrel-shaped spore, with a spore-wall composed of three layers, 280 - 350 nm thick. Most spores are octosporous microspores, dimensions 2.0-3.1 X 2.0-2.7 um in fixed preparations, but a small number of macrospores, 3.5 -4.5 X 2.8 -3.0 um, are produced in pansporoblasts with four spores. Both spore types with a single nucleus and a nearly identical fine structure. The anehoring disc is small and the straight part of the polar filament reaches the posterior pole of the spore. It is surrounded by a polaroplast composed of two structurally different parts. The anterior part is about 1/3 of the spore length, the posterior about 2/3. The polar filament is of approximately uniform thickness all over its length. In microspores the diameter is 120 -140 nm, in macrospores it is slightly bigger, 125-150 nm. The polar filament of microspores is posteriorly arranged as 4-5 coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt of the first fila- ment coil is approximately 45 degrees. In macrospores the posterior part of the filament is ar- ranged as 8 irregularly stacked coils. Sporogony occurs in a pansporoblast trans versed by a fibrous material continuous from the spore wall to the pansporoblast membrane, which has a hair-like fibrous appearance.

The parasite is similar to the recently described T. hominis Hollister, Canning, Weidner, Field, Kench and Marriott, 1996, in having isolated nuclei, meronts with a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of their plasmalemma and sporogony during which spores are formed inside a thick-walled sporophorous vesicle. In contrast to T. hominis, this species is dimorphic as it forms two kinds of sporophorous vesicles and spores: Type I - round to oval polysporous sporophorous vesicle, 7-10 μm in size, usually with eight spores (3.7 x 2.0 μm), thick endospores, subterminal anchoring disc and anisofilar polar filaments forming seven thicker and two thinner terminal coils.

A new microsporidian Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. was isolated from a muscle lesion of the streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus Cuvier, 1798 (Mammalia, Tenrecidae), an insectivore endemic to Madagascar. The spores isolated from the tenrec were infectious to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intramuscular injection. Material obtained from muscular lesions in mice was used for the parasite description. All developmental stages of the microsporidian were covered by a dense coat, which during sporogony changed into the sporophorous vesicle wall. Eight, 16, 32, or more spores were formed inside the sporophorous vesicle as the result of the division by plasmotomy and sequential fission of a multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium. Spores were ovoid, 4.7 × 2.8 μm in size, had a large posterior vacuole, and had an isofilar polar tube with 15–16 coils. Although the fine structure and the developmental pattern of the organism were in some respects similar to the genus Vavraia, molecular phylogeny based on the gene sequences of the small subunit rRNA and RNA polymerase subunit II indicated that the organism belongs to the genus Trachipleistophora.

Another species, Encephalitozoon (Septata) intestinalis, is associated with diarrhea and chronic sinusitis, and approximately 25 cases have been reported in the literature. However, other microsporidial infections in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients remain extremely rare. We report the first case of a Pleistophora sp.-like microsporidian infection presenting as a progressive severe myosotis associated with fever and weight loss. The organism was demonstrated by light microscopy and electron microscopy in corneal scrapings, skeletal muscle, and nasal discharge. Electron microscopy showed an electron-dense surface coat with ''sun-flare''-like projections surrounding all stages of development of meronts (two to four nuclei, dividing by binary fission), sporonts, and sporoblasts.

J. Clin. Pathol. 106: 535-43, 1996) (hereafter referred to as HMY) was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy and compared with Thelohania apodemi Doby, Jeannes et Raoult, 1963, a microsporidian of small rodents. The fine structure of the HMY was found to be similar to that of Trachipleistophora hominis Hollister, Canning, Weldner, Field, Kench et Marriott, 1996. Characteristic is the presence of a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of the meront plasmalemma, which is maintained during the whole life cycle and which later persists as an electron dense coat on the sporophorous vesicle (SPOV). However, HMY is distinguished from T. hominis during sporogony, as two types of SPOV and spores are formed in HMY. One type of SPOV contains thick-walled spores (usually 8 or more in number) with anisofilar polar filaments of 7 + 2 pattern, while the other type contains only two thin-walled spores with a smaller number (3-5) of isofilar polar filament coils. The HMY differs from T. apodemi which also forms SPOV with 8 spores inside, but the spores of which are larger in size and have 9 + 2 polar filament pattern.",,,Canada (Marriott)

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Four merozoites with lobed protrusions are formed by rosette-like division. Sporonts develop into plasmodia with eight isolated nuclei. Sporoblasts are formed by rosette-like budding in a spherical, persistent sporophorous vesicle, generated by the sporont. No inclusions of the episporontal space are visible using light microscopy. Two kinds of projections are formed by the lobed sporogonial plasmodium: chains of globular components, which disappear when the sporoblasts are released, and arrays of persistent fibrillar material, which connect the sporblasts with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Mature spores are oval, with pointed anterior pole, and with about five fibrous posterior projections, which are visible with difficulty using light microscopy, but distinct in electron microscopy. Unfixed spores measure 4.2–4.6 × 6.3–7.0 µm. The spore wall has distinct endo- and exospore layers. The exospore is three-layered, with a lucent surface layer, a median double-layer and an internal granular layer of variable thickness. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, sac-like chambers posteriorly. The polar filament is anisofilar with 3–4, 238–316 nm wide anterior coils and 4–5, 192–209 nm wide posterior coils in a single row close to the spore wall in the posterior half of the spore.

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. In the merogonial reproduction multinucleate plasmodia divide by plasmotomy, yielding uninucleate merozoites. Sporonts develop into multinucleate plasmodia, which split in a rosette-like manner, initially into wide lobes with large nuclei, finally into narrow lobes with small nuclei. Sporoblasts are formed in individual sporophorous vesicles generated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Immature sporogonial stages are covered by fibrillar projections uniting the exospore with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Mature spores, which are pyriform with pointed anterior end, normally lack projections. Unfixed spores measure 4.6-5.7x2.7-3.3 urn. The exospore is four-layered. The anterior lamellae of the polaroplast are wide. The posterior ones (present in a short zone) are narrow close to the filament, wider at the periphery. The polar filament is isofilar with 9-10, 102-131 nm wide, coils in a single layer close to the spore wall in posterior half of the spore. The angle of tilt is 60-65°. Isometric, 21-25 nm wide virus-like particles were observed in the nuclei of mature spores. Experimental transmission of the microsporidium per os has failed.

Tanzania in 1985 and 1987 and from two additional sites, both within about 2 mi of the original one in 1987. An octosporous microsporidian, present at all three sites, was found in both years infecting from 7 to 22% of larvae. Spores (stained in Giemsa) measured 3.0 microns +/- 0.25 microns x 2.25 microns +/- 0.26 microns. Ultrastructurally, spores were seen to have an anterior rim surrounding a depressed area where the endospore was at its thinnest. In transmission electron microscopy section, the rim appeared as two processes into which all layers of the wall extended. At the posterior end all layers of the wall extended into a simple knob-like structure which could be interpreted as a section through a crest running longitudinally around the spore. The polar filament was anisofilar, with two anterior coils of greater diameter than the three posterior coils.

Abstract A new microsporidium was isolated from the endemic, Taiwanese shrimp, Caridina formosae (Decapoda, Atyidae) from northern Taiwan. A conspicuous symptom of infection was presence of opaque white xenomas located in the proximity of the alimentary tract, the surface of the hepatopancreas, and the gills. A fully developed xenoma consisted of a hard, thick capsule filled with sporophorous vesicles containing multiple spores. Microsporidia developed synchronously within the same sporophorous vesicle, although the stage of parasite development differed among the vesicles. Fresh spores were pyriform, mononucleated and measured 6.53×4.38μm. The polar filament was anisofilar with 9–11 coils. Phylogenetic analysis based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence showed that the isolate is most similar to the fish microsporidian clade containing the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Teramicra. The highest sequence identity, 80%, was with Spraguea spp. Based on pathogenesis, life cycle and phylogenetic analysis, we erect a new genus and species, Triwangia caridinae for the novel microsporidium.",Taiwan,Taiwan (),Taiwan ()

Its description, based on one of the first ultrastructural studies of microsporidia from orthopteran hosts, lacked information on the details of cell surface structure, which are considered to be very important in modern taxonomy. We have re-investigated the material upon which the original description of N. maroccanus was based and revealed new ultrastructural characters of its cell surface. Late meronts are surrounded with microtubuli, about 20 nm in diameter, attached to the membrane, later replaced with electron dense granules, forming a typical coating of the sporont's surface (the primordium of exospore). Mature spores are also surrounded with a layer of microtubuli. Host cell cytoplasm contains small vesicles with electron-dense cores, up to 50 nm in diameter, surrounding late meronts, sporogonial stages and spores of the parasite. Polar tube is slightly anisofilar. These characters disagree with the diagnosis of Nosema, but fit that of the recently established genus Tubulinosema. Hence, we transferred the species studied into this genus, establishing Tubulinosema maroccanus comb. nov. Analysis of cell surface ultrastructure of two Tubulinosema species from Orthoptera showed that they shared two characters not mentioned in the diagnosis of the genus. Therefore, the diagnosis of Tubulinosema was modified to include two more characters: presence of vesicles with electron-dense cores surrounding sporogonial stages and presence of microtubuli not only in late meronts, but also, in some species, in spores.",Uzbekistan,Uzbekistan (),Uzbekistan ()

O. sulcatus populations from several locations were sampled and evaluated for microsporidiosis. A very low prevalence of the disease was observed in all locations surveyed (<3.0%). Laboratory studies were conducted by orally exposing both larvae and adults of O. sulcatus to varying concentrations of Canningia sp. spores. Larval bioassays at a variety of dosages (0, 10, etc.) were performed to evaluate pathogen infectivity, larval survival and growth. Adult bioassays (dosages: 0, 10, etc.) were performed to evaluate longevity, fecundity and mechanisms of vertical pathogen transmission. Larvae and adults were infected in all spore treatments. Larval growth was significantly reduced at dosages above 10 spores/larva. Adults infected at all dosages experienced high levels of mortality and fecundity was reduced to zero. Greenhouse trials were performed to determine if larvae feeding in soil acquired infections when spores were topically applied as a drench application (0, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7 spores/pot).

Five larvae from three localities were infected with B. bassiana, 37 larvae from six localities were infected with the granulosis virus, and 69 larvae from 5 locations were infected with the microsporidian. Laboratory trials confirmed that B. bassiana and the granulosis virus caused coneworm mortality. B. bassiana isolates from all three locations were equally virulent to late instar larvae. Spores of the unidentified microsporidian are free, elongate oval, binucleate and contain 13-14 turns of an isofilar polar filament. The primary sites of infection were the Malpighian tubules and the silk glands. The microsporidian was found in 2 to 51% of larvae sampled.

In adult females the parasite was restricted to gonadal tissue, in particular primary and secondary follicle cells. Spores were diplokaryotic with a thin spore wall and a short polar filament, characteristics typical of 'early' spores involved in autoinfection. The diplokaryotic life-cycle, absence of spore groupings and of a pansporoblast membrane typify the genus Nosema. However, the unusual globular polaroplast of the spore and restriction of this stage to host ovarian tissue, have not previously been described in Nosema. Sporogony occurred only in follicle cells adjacent to developing oocytes and was in synchrony with the process of vitellogenesis. Oocytes were infected after formation of intracellular connections with follicle cells but harboured only vegetative stages of the parasite. Parasites were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm and, in developing embryos, segregated to daughter cells along the axis of the spindle. In juvenile animals there was no evidence of pathology linked with feminization and the parasite was found at low density in cells under the cuticle.

This microsporidian species is monomorphic, disporous and develops in direct contact with the cytoplasm of the host cell. The nuclear configuration of merogonic and sporogonic stages was diplokaryotic. The merogonic proliferative stage was unusual that normal development with 1, 2 and 4 binucleated forms were common, while large multinucleate meronts containing 8 and 12 small compact horseshoe-like diplokaryotic nuclei were also observed. The fresh spores were typically ovocylindrical in shape, with a mean size of 3·91×1·91 μm and the polar filament length was ~90 μm. Infection was systemic with mature spores produced in the midgut, nervous tissue, muscles, labial glands, gonads, tracheae, epidermis, Malpighian tubules and, most extensively, fat body tissues.

670,Unnamed Pleistophora sp.,"ltrastructure, development, and host–parasite relationship of a new species of the genus Pleistophora—a microsporidian parasite of the marine fish Epinephelus chlorostignei ::: The life cycle of a new microsporidian of the genus Pleistophora is described. This parasite infects the epithelial cells of the gut and the peritoneal cavity of the Red Sea fish, Epinephelus chlorostignei. All stages develop within a special structure, the sporophorocyst, which is covered by a thick dense wall. This wall grows along with the growth of the parasites inside. Meronts are uni- to binucleate, which divide and constantly give rise to sporonts. During transition to sporonts, the cell border of the meronts increases its thickness, temporarily featuring thick irregular projections. Eventually, a uniform thick sporont wall is formed; then, the sporont cells detach themselves from the wall (future wall of the sporophorous vesicle, SPV) and start a series of divisions to produce sporoblasts. The SPV wall is compact, has no pores, and consists of two layers. Mature spores measure about 2.0 × 1.8 µm. They possess a polar filament with 20–28 coils, a posterior vacuole, and a polaroplast made up of an outer part of dense and closely spaced lamellae encircling an inner part of widely spaced lamellae.

Because H. undalis is difficult to control by chemical insecticides and microbiological control techniques have not been established, we investigated the biology, the pathogenicity and transmission of this pathogen found in H. undalis. An average of 16% of larvae obtained from crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija displayed microsporidian infections and 75% of infected H. undalis died during larval development. Histopathological studies revealed that the infection is initiated in the midgut and then spreads to all organs. The microsporidium has two different sporulation sequences: a disporoblastic development producing binucleate free mature spores and an octosporoblastic development forming eight uninucleate spores. These two discrete life cycles imply its taxonomic assignment to the genus Vairimorpha. The size of the binucleate, diplokaryotic spores as measured on Giemsa-stained smears was 3.56±0.29μm in length and 2.18±0.21μm in width, whereas the uninucleate octospores measured 2.44±0.20×1.64±0.14μm.

Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, each of which gave rise to four sporoblasts in a rosette-shaped plasmodium, so that eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent ovoid SPV.

(Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) ::: The microsporidian genus Nosema is characterized by development in direct control with host cell cytoplasm, diplokaryotic nuclei throughout development and disporous sporogony. The genus Vairimorpha exhibits the same features plus an octoporous sporogony producing uninucleate spores in a sporophorous vesicle. A microsporidium from diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, falls between Nosema and Vairimorpha in that it initiates but fails to complete the octosporous sequence in this host. The name Vairimorpha imperfecta n.sp. is proposed. Merogony is mainly by formation of buds from multinucleate meronts, the buds remaining attached in chains. Diplokaryotic spores measure 4.3 x 2.0 microns (fresh) and have 15.5 coils of the polar tube in 1 rank. The octosporous sporogony is aborted owing to irregular formation of nuclear spindles, incomplete cytoplasmic fission and bizarre deposition of electron-dense episporontal secretions. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the small subunit rRNA genes of V. imperfecta and of several Nosema and Vairimorpha spp. place V. imperfecta in a clade with Nosema spp. from Lepidoptera rather than in the clade containing the more typical species of Vairimorpha. It is suggested that the ancestors of the Vairimorpha/Nosema complex of species exhibited both disporous and octosporous sporogonies, as does the type species of Vairimorpha, Vairimorpha necatrix. It would follow that true Nosema spp. have lost the ability to express an octosporous sequence and that V. imperfecta is in the process of losing it. It is proposed that the genera Nosema and Vairimorpha be placed in the same family Nosematidae Labbé 1899, rather than in separate families and orders as at present.",Malaysia,Malaysia (),Diplokaryotic ()

The parasite is dimorphic, producing two morphologically distinct typcs of spores, which develop sequentially in the same fat cells or oenocytes in the fat body. The binucleate free spores develop from disporous sporonts; the uninuclcate octospores develop from multinucleate sporonts wih a sporophorous vesicle. lnfected cells are transformed into large sacs which contain both types of spores in mature adult hosts. Mature free spores are often present by the time the larvae pupate, but mature octospores are found only in adult hosts. Masses of spores may be seen through the intact cuticle by low power phase-contrast microscopy; there are no other physical signs and no behavioral signs of infection. Attempts to transmit the infection in the laboratory failed.",Brazil,Brazil (),Brazil ()
680,Vairimorpha necatrix BM,"Morphological and molecular studies of Vairimorpha necatrix BM, a new strain of the microsporidium V. necatrix (microsporidia, burenellidae) recorded in the silkworm, Bombyx mori ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • This is a new study on the Vairimorpha necatrix recorder in the silkworm Bombyx mori. • Diplokaryotic spores (4.7±0.2×2.1±0.2μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 13–17 coils. • Almost all the tissues of silkworm were the targets for Vairimorpha necatrix BM but no infection in the ovary. • There is no vertical transmission in silkworm after Vairimorpha necatrix BM infection. Abstract Vairimorpha sp. BM (2012) is a recent isolate of the microsporidia from the silkworm in Shandong, China. The ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization of this isolate is described in this study. This pathogenic fungus causes pebrine disease in silkworms which manifests as a systemic infection. Meanwhile, the silkworm eggs produced by the infected moths were examined using a microscope and PCR amplification. Neither spores nor the expected PCR band were observed, suggesting that no vertical transmission occurred in Bombyx mori. In addition, the ultrastructure of the isolate was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two types of spores were observed: diplokaroytic spores with 13–17 coils of polar tubes and monokaryotic spores with less coils of polar tubes which could form octospores; however, no sporophorous vesicles were observed. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA genes of Vairimorpha species showed that this isolate has a closer relationship to Vairimorpha necatrix than the other species studied. This result also is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on their actin genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and RNA polymerase II (RPB1). Based on the information gained during this study, we propose that this microsporidian species infecting B. mori should be given the name V. necatrix BM.",(Shandong) China,China (Shandong),China (Shandong)

The microsporidium produces systemic infections in O. lida larvae; the midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, and midgut muscle tissues were the target tissues for this isolate, and atrophied fat body tissues were found in heavily infected larvae. Two types of spores were observed, diplokaroytic spores with 11–13 coils of polar tube, and monokaryotic spores with 12 coils of the polar tube that developed within a sporophorous vesicle to form octospores. Electron-dense granules were abundant in the episporontal space of the sporophorous vesicles, and were similar to those of Vairimorpha invictae isolated from Solenopsis invicta, but different from granules or inclusions of other Vairimorpha species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence, this isolate is unique within the Vairimorpha complex.

The spores were long oval and measured 3.4 × 1.6 μm on fresh smears. Ultrastructure of the spores was characteristic for the genus Vairimorpha: 13–15 polar filament coils, posterior vacuole, and a diplokaryon. Six chromosome bands have been separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The sequenced complete rRNA gene of this isolate is 4,231 bp long. Phylogenetic analysis based on SSU rRNA gene and LSU rRNA gene both revealed that this novel microsporidian which was isolated from B. mori had close relationship to the genus Vairimorpha, not to the genus Nosema. Moreover, the organization of the rRNA units of this microsporidian is not similar to that of Nosema bombycis, but same to that of other microsporidian, such as Vairimorpha necatrix.

Comparison with equivalent sequence data obtained here for two other microsporidian species, Nosema bombycis (240 base pairs) and Nosema bombi (200 base pairs), and from the GenBank database for 11 other microsporidian species suggests that the unidentified species from P. rapaeis most closely related to some Vairimorpha species. Light and electron microscopic observations of the developmental stages of this parasite were in accord with this. Infection experiments conducted at 20 and 26°C demonstrated temperature-dependent dimorphism, with the production of both binucleate free spores (mean dimensions: 3.8 × 1.8 μm; 10–13 polar filament coils) and membrane-bound uninucleate octospores (mean dimensions of 3.1 × 1.9 μm). Macrospores (mean dimensions 8.0 × 2.1 μm) were also observed. Sites of infection were the gut epithelium, the Malpighian tubules, the salivary glands, and the fat body.

(Microsporidia: Burnellidae) on Trichogramma chilonis (Hymenoptera, Trichogrammatidae), a hymenopteran parasitoid of the cabbage moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae) ::: A multi-generation mass breeding colony of the cabbage moth, Plutella xylostella, was found to be infected with a microsporidium, Vairimorpha sp., which is passed transovarially between generations. The microsporidian infection had little impact on the fitness of this lepidopteran pest. However, when Trichogramma chilonis parasitized such infected host eggs, the offspring of this parasitoid species suffered from severe deficiencies. Microsporidian spores, ingested by parasitoid larvae together with the host egg nutrients, gave rise to stages which developed in various tissues of the parasitoid, such as the flight muscle and the nervous system. This infection resulted in a significantly increased rate of metamorphosis failure (related to host age) and reduced longevity and reproductive performance of the parasitoids. There are two main consequences arising from our findings if T. chilonis is to be used in an integrated control strategy against P. xylostella: (1) T. chilonis must be raised on Vairimorpha-free host eggs to receive viable and efficaceous parasitoids for release and (2) if natural populations of the cabbage moth in cruciferous crops are infected with Vairimorpha to a significant extent, the parasitoid must be released repeatedly within infested crop areas.",U.S.A.,United States (),

The pathogenicity was quantified using a standard bioassay procedure by infecting second instar larvae per os with variable dose levels of the pathogen. Vairimorpha sp. caused 100% mortality even at a dosage of 1.5 x 103 spores per larva. The median lethal dose (LD50) was 2.2 x 104 spores per larva on day 5 post-inoculation. The time taken to achieve 90-100% mortality was dose dependent and varied from 5 days with 1.5 x 106 spores per larva to 11 days with 1.5 x 103 spores per larva. The pathogen reduced the food consumption of P. xylostella larvae by 75%, 93% and 95% at doses 1.5 x 104, 1.5 x 105 and 1.5 x 106 spores per larva, respectively. Histological observations showed that the pathogen preferentially infected adipose tissue cells but spread to almost all tissues.

(Microsporidia, Pleistophoridae) in the Brazilian solar salterns ::: A high prevalence of microsporidiosis was detected in an extensive culture of Artemia in two Brazilian solar salterns. The disease was responsible for the disruption of both the eggs and the biomass production. The main microsporidian is primarily a muscular parasite, with pansporoblastic development. All stages presented isolated nuclei. In merogonial stages, the amorphous coat divided with the cell, whereas in the sporogonial plasmodia the protoplasm retracted away from the coat, producing the vesicule cavity. Sporogonial division occurred both stepwise and by rosette-shape fragmentation. The number of nuclei in mature sporonts was variable and sometimes exceeded 64. As the sporophorous vesicle became mature, the matrix was occupied by metabolic granular products that became tubular. Microspores (3.3 × 2.1 μm) and macrospores (4.1 × 2.7 μm) were observed. The number of coils of the anisofilar filament was 11 (microspores) and 15 (macrospores).

This parasite was monomorphic with polysporous sporogony and developed in the skeletal muscle of the host. The multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium divided by plasmotomy and multiple division into uninucleate sporoblasts. All stages were surrounded by a thick and amorphous dense coat external to the plasmalemma. This structure gradually became a merontogenetic sporophorous vacuole (MSV) where the sporonts developed into sporoblasts. The MSV was filled with episporontal granular secretory products and eventually contained up to 50 uninucleate spores. During spore morphogenesis, these episporontal granular products within the MSV became organized as episporontal tubular-like structures. In transverse sections, these structures showed a mean diameter of 1.0 μm, but disappeared during the final phase of the spore maturation. Mature spores were ellipsoidal to slightly pyriform and measured 2.30 × 1.41 μm. The polar filament was anisofilar and consisted of a single coil with six to seven turns (rarely five).

A diplokaryotic microsporidian was found infecting all nematogens from all the samples taken in both years. The infected cells contained all developmental stages. Merogony initially was monokaryotic and sporogony of diplokaryotic sporonts was by multiple fission. The stained ovoidal spores measured between 4.3-6 μm x 1.7-2.3 μm. The ultrastructural findings come from 11 specimens of Kantharella antarctica that were cut in serial sections. All developmental stages were noteworthy because of the myelinosomes situated adjacent to each diplokaryon. Similarly conspicuous were some organelles in the spore: a prominent, extraordinarily electron dense anterior portion of the polaroplast and the posterior vacuole. The isofilar polar filament with a diameter of about i 15 nm showed 9-11 coils. The great number of empty spore cases together with an extruded polar filament are indicative of an autoinfection.
