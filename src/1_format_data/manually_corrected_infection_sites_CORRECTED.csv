Acarispora falculifera,"Ultrastructural characterization of Acarispora falculifera n.gen., n.sp., a new microsporidium (Opisthokonta: Chytridiopsida) from the feather mite Falculifer rostratus (Astigmata: Pterolichoidea). Only about 20 species of microsporidia have been described from mites. All except one species produce typical spores with a long polar filament and a polaroplast. This paper is the first study of an atypical microsporidium infection in a feather mite (Falculifer rostratus). The infection of the pigeon feather mite is restricted to the colon epithelium where it leads to hypertrophy of the concerned cells. During sporogony, a multinucleate plasmodial aggregate is formed within a sporont (endogenous sporogony resulting in a polysporophorous vesicle). The cisterns delimiting the single sporoblasts later form the spore walls. Sporogonial stages are in direct contact to the host cell cytoplasm. Merogonial stages were not present. Spores are tiny (3.6 μm × 2.6 μm), broad oval in form and monokaryotic. The spore wall of mature spores consists of a three-layered endospore and a thin, electron-dense, wavy exospore. The polar filament is anisofilar and completely coiled in 3–4 turns. In cross-sections, it has a star-like appearance because the electron-dense core forms rounded compartments of lucent material at its surface. In superficial sections, this results in a honeycomb-like pattern. A polaroplast is missing. The polar filament arises subapically at a polar sac that lacks an internal anchoring disk. These atypical spore structures clearly classify the species from the feather mite as a member of the order Chytridiopsida. It could not be clearly affiliated to one of the known genera, so we created a new genus, Acarispora, with the species A.

Agglomerata cladocera (siberian isolate),"Microsporidia Alfvenia sibirica sp. n. and Agglomerata cladocera (Pfeiffer) 1895, from Siberian microcrustaceans and phylogenetic relationships within the “Aquatic outgroup” lineage of fresh water microsporidia. Here we report on two microsporidia from freshwater crustaceans collected during the ongoing survey for microsporidia in the river Karasuk and adjacent waterbodies (Novosibirsk region, Western Siberia). The first species parasitized hypoderm and fat body of a cyclopid Cyclops sp. (Maxillopoda, Copedoda) and produced oval spores, measured 2.0×3.6μm (fixed) enclosed individually or in small groups in fragile sporophorous vesicles (SVs). We describe it here as Alfvenia sibirica sp. n. The second species infected the same tissues of a cladoceran Daphnia magna (Branchiopoda, Phyllopoda). Its spores were pyriform, 2.3×4.0μm (fixed), and resided in relatively persistent SVs in groups of 8–16. This species was identified as a Siberian isolate (Si) of Agglomerata cladocera (Pfeifer) because ultrastructurally it was hardly distinguishable from A. cladocera recorded from England from the same host (Larsson et al., 1996). A. cladocera (Si) shared 99% SSU rDNA sequence similarity to Binucleata daphniae from D. magna collected in Belgium (Refardt et al., 2008). The major outcome of our work is that we present molecular (SSUrDNA) characterization coupled with EM description, for representatives of two genera, Alfvenia (encompasses 3 described so far species) and Agglomerata (7 species), which allowed us to place these two genera on the phylogenetic tree. We also summarized the literature data on Alfvenia and Agglomerata spp., and provided their comparative morphological analysis. These two genera belong to so called “Aquatic outgroup” (Vossbrinck et al., 2004), a poorly resolved lineage, a sister to Amblyosporidae. This lineage probably includes majority of fresh water forms of microsporidia, most of which remain undescribed. SSUrDNA-based phylogenetic analysis and analysis of hosts suggest that diversification within the “Aquatic outgroup” could have been connected with the host switch from dipterans or copepods to cladocerans that had occurred in some ancestral Amblyospora-related lineage(s).",Agglomerata cladocera,Daphnia magna,Hypoderm; adipose,NA,adipose,NA,NA,NA
Agglomerata connexa,"Ultrastructural study of Agglomerata connexa sp. nov. (Microspora, Duboscqiidae), a new microsporidian parasite of Daphnia longispina (Cladocera, Daphniidae). The new microsporidium, Agglomerata connexa sp. nov., is described, based primarily on ultrastructural characteristies. The parasite infeets the adipose tissue of Daphnia longispina O.F. Müller, 1785. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Sporogonial reproduction is by rosette- or finger-like budding. Sporophorous vesicles contain not more than 4 mature spores, most vesicles are monosporous, and usually devoid of inclusions. Rare aggregates of tubules are visible inside multisporaus and outside of individual sporophorous vesicles. Often two or moreindividual vesieles form a chain-like strueture. Unfixed spores are pyriform, measuring 4.08 ± 0.27 x 2.72 ± 0.24 um. The exospore is layered, approximately 30 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar, 140 nm wide, making 5-7 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has three subdivisions: wide lamellae, narrow lamellae and tubules. Diserimination from other microsporidian species is discussed.",Agglomerata connexa,Daphnia longispina,adipose tissue; systemic infection,NA,systemic infection,NA,NA,NA
Agglomerata lacrima,"Ultrastructure and light microscopic cytology of Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. (Microspora, Duboscqiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Acanthocyclops vernalis (Copepoda, Cyclopidae). Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. is the first species of the genus described from a copepod host (Acanthocyclops vernalis.) It was studied using light- and electron-microscopy. All stages of the life-cycle had isolated nuclei. The earliest stages found were uninucleate merozoites. Sporogony produced 4-12 (mostly 8) pyriform spores by rosette-like budding within a fragile sporophorous vesicle. Live spores measured 4.4 +/- 0.2 x 2.6 +/- 0.2 μm, and fixed spores measured 3.7 +/- 0.2 x 1.6 +/- 0.2 μm. The exospore was constructed of 4 layers. The anisofilar polar filament made 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast had an anterior part with wide lamellae (chambers), followed by a second zone of narrow lamellae. Tubule-like structures which might constitute a third polaroplast region were present immediately anterior to the first filament coil. Cytological characteristics and the generic position of the species are discussed, and it is compared to related or resembling species, and to all previously reported microsporidian species from copepods.",Agglomerata lacrima,Acanthocyclops vernalis,hypodermal; adipose,NA,hypodermal; adipose,NA,NA,NA
Agglomerata volgensae,"Light and electron microscopic study of Agglomerata volgensae n. sp. (Microspora: Dubosqiidae), a new microsporidian parasite of Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Daphniidae). The new microsporidium Agglomerata volgensae n. sp. is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. The parasite invades the hypoderm and adipose tissue of Daphnia magna and causes hypertrophy. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Sporogonial plasmodia divide by rosette-like division, producing 4-16, usually 8, sporoblasts. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated after the first nuclear division of the sporont. The fragile vesicle either collects all daughter cells of the sporont, or the vesicle divides together with the plasmodium to enclose spores in individual sporophorous vesicles. Fibril-like projections connect the exospore with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Tubules, with walls of exospore material, are formed together with the sporoblasts. Mature spores are pyriform with pointed anterior pole and an obliquely positioned posterior vacuole. Unfixed spores measure 3.2-3.7x1.7-2.0 μm. The exospore is layered, approximately 38 nm thick. The polar filament is lightly anisofilar with 2-3 wide anterior coils, and 2-3 more narrow posterior coils, in a single layer of coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has two regions: irregular wide lamellae or chambers surrounding the straight part of the filament, and more loosely arranged narrow lamellae in the coil region. The discrimination from other microsporidian species and the systematic position are briefly discussed.",Agglomerata volgensae,Daphnia magna,hypodermal; adipose,NA,hypodermal,NA,hypoderm,NA

A microsporidian infection, due to Alloglugea bufonis nov. gen., nov. sp., is described in the tadpoles and newly metamorphosed toads of Bufo marinus from a lake near Belem, Para, north Brazil. Xenomas occur either singly in the lamina propria of the intestine, or aggregated into cystic bodies of up to 0.2 mm diameter, which emerge above the intestine surface. The xenoma is bounded by a folded plasmalemma with pinocytotic depressions, and there is a central, enlarged nucleus. Plasmodial stages and elongate meronts differentiate ~ n t o ribbon-shaped sporonts and single-nucleated sporo- blasts. The spore cytoplasm is invaginated at the posterior end. Spores escape from the mature xeno- mas into reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen and kidneys of the tadpoles and newly metamorphosed toads, but infection is gradually lost after metamorphosis.",Alloglugea bufonis,Bufo marinus,intestines; liver; spleen; kidney; macrophages; phagocytes,lamina propria; reticuloendothelial cells; blood vessels; glomeruli,intestines; macrophages; phagocytes,blood vessels; glomeruli,lamina propria of the intestine,NA
Alternosema bostrichidis,"Ultrastructure, molecular phylogeny, and prevalence rates of Alternosema bostrichidis gen. nov. sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Terresporidia), a parasite of Prostephanus truncatus and Dinoderus spp. (Coleoptera, Bostrichidae). A new species and a new genus of a microsporidium Alternosema bostrichidis isolated from an adult Prostephanus truncatus in Mexico and from three species of the genus Dinoderus in Nigeria are described. The microsporidium is monomorphic, monoxenic, and develops in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The infection first appears with thoracic muscles, followed by a generalized invasion of the host. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. Mature spores are ovoid. Unfixed spores measure 3.7–4.2 × 2.0–2.6 μm, fixed and stained spores 3.5–5.0 × 2.4–2.8 μm. The polaroplast consists of dense lamellae and rare lamellae. The polar tube is slightly anisofilar, consisting of 11–17 coils, with 9–14 proximal (130 nm in diameter) and 2–3 distal coils (120 nm in diameter) arranged in one layer. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based upon a short portion of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Genbank accession # KP455651) placed the new microsporidium within Liebermannia-Orthosomella lineage, which contains multiple undescribed parasites. In particular, A. bostrichidis showed maximal sequence similarity of 95% to Microsporidium sp.

Amazonspora hassar,"Amazonspora hassar n. gen. and n. sp. (Phylum Microsporidia, fam. Glugeidae), a parasite of the Amazonian teleost Hassar orestis (fam. Doradidae). We describe the microsporidian Amazonspora hassar n. gen., n. sp. from the gill xenomas of the teleost Hassar orestis (Doradidae) collected in the estuarine region of the Amazon River. The parasite appeared as a small whitish xenoma located in the gill filaments near the blood vessels. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic host cell (HHC) in the cytoplasm of which the microsporidian developed and proliferated. The xenoma wall was composed of up to approximately 22 juxtaposed crossed layers of collagen fibers. The plasmalemma of the HHC presented numerous anastomosed, microvilli-like structures projecting outward through the 1-3 first internal layers of the collagen fibrils. The parasite was in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm in all stages of the cycle (merogony and sporogony). Sporogony appears to divide by plasmotomy, giving rise to 4 uninucleate sporoblasts, which develop into uninucleate spores. The ellipsoidal spores measured 2.69 ± 0.45 × 1.78 ± 0.18 μm, and the wall measured ∼75 nm. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, being shifted laterally from the anterior pole. The polar filament was arranged into 7-8 coils in a single layer in the posterior half of the spore, surrounding the posterior vacuole. The polaroplast surrounded the uncoiled portion of the polar filament, and it was exclusively lamellar. The spores and different life-cycle stages were intermingled within the cytoplasm of the HHC, surrounding the central hypertrophic deeply branched nucleus. The ultrastructural morphology of this microsporidian parasite suggests the erection of a new genus and species.",Amazonspora hassar,Hassar orestis,gills,NA,gills,NA,gill filaments,NA

Amblyospora bakcharia,"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching. Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Amblyospora bakcharia,NA,Adipose in larvae,NA,Adipose in larvae,NA,NA,NA

Amblyospora camposi,"Life cycle and description of Amblyospora camposi n. sp. (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae) in the mosquito Culex renatoi (Diptera, Culicidae) and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus (Copepoda, Cyclopidae). The life cycle of Amblyospora camposi n. sp. is described from the mosquito Culex renatoi and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus collected in the leaf axils of the plant Eryngium cabrerae in Argentina. Meiospores of A. camposi (5.8 x 4.1 μm) were infectious per os to female adults of the copepod P. f. fimbriatus. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei, with sporulation involving the formation of a sub-persistent, sporontogenic, interfacial envelope and the production of a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of P. f. fimbriatus, were large, pyriform, and measured 10.70 x 3.85 μm. When ingested they infected C. renatoi larvae to initiate a sequence that involves schizogony and gametogony and ends with plasmogamy and nuclear association to form diplokaryotic meronts. Oblong ovate binucleate spores (7.86 x 2.96 μm) are formed in the adult mosquito and are responsible for vertical transmission to the filial generation. This is the first report of an Amblyospora species from a mosquito that inhabits the small-water bodies held in parts of terresterial plants (phytotelmata).",Amblyospora camposi,Culex renatoi; Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus,adipose; ovarian,NA,adipose; ovarian,NA,ovaries (Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus),NA
Amblyospora cataphyllus,"Microsporidians in bloodsucking Aedes (O.) cataphylla mosquitoes in Ukraine [Mikrosporidii krovososushchikh komarov Aedes (O.) cataphylla Ukrainy.]. The paper reports the results of studies on Microsporidia from the bloodsucking mosquito Aedes cataphylla for the period from 1974 undertaken in the Kiev and Chernigov Provinces of the Ukraine. A new species, Amblyospora cataphyllus sp. n., is described from larvae of the mosquito. Living spores oval or elongate-oval, 6.3--7.5 x 4.5--5.0 (most commonly 6.8 x 4.8) microns, fixed spores oval, 5.6--6.9 x 3.8--4.8 microns. Mucocalyx becomes distinct around spores in 10 to 15 days after the preparation is made. Spontaneously ejected polar tube 125 microns long. Exospore smooth or undulate, 170 to 310 nm thick, endospore 60 to 160 nm. Polaroplast elongated and curved, its 1/3 is composed of closely situated plates and 2/3 of more widely arranged ones. Polar tube anisophyllous, forms 18 to 20 spires in a spore, of which 3 to 5 spires form basal area and 14 to 16 form distal area (of them 1-2 most thick spires form intermediate area). Nucleus large, in a shape of half-ring. In living spores posterior vacuole crescentic, in fixed ones it is strongly deformed together with hind pole of spores. Sporogony of Microsporidia takes place in larvae of mosquitoes of both sexes. Infection extensiveness of IV stage larvae is 10%.",Amblyospora cataphyllus,Aedes cataphylla,fat body,NA,fat body,NA,NA,NA

Amblyospora chulymia,"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching. Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Amblyospora chulymia,NA,Adipose in larvae,NA,Adipose in larvae,NA,NA,NA

The ultrastructure of meiospores of six different species of Amblyospora found infecting larval mosquitoes of Aedes abserratus, Aedes aurifer, Aedes cinereus, Aedes excruciates, Aedes sticticus, and Aedes stimulans are described. Meiospores of all species exhibited characteristics typical for the genus Amblyospora including: a single nucleus, a large posterior vacuole, a thick undulating exospore and thinner endospore, a bipartite and lamellate polaroplast with more tightly stacked membranes in the proximal region, and an anisofilar polar filament with distal coils reduced in thickness. Distinct differences were found in the arrangement and number/ ratio of coils formed by the broad basal and narrow distal portions of the polar filament. These differences, when quantified and averaged, were unique from all other mosquito‐parasitic species that have been examined ultrastructurally. Information on parasite development, natural field prevalence and transmission to suspected intermediate copepod hosts is presented. The creation of six new species, Amblyospora abserrati, Amblyospora auriferi, Amblyospora cinerei, Amblyospora excrucii, Amblyospora stictici, and Amblyospora stimuli is proposed.

Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Amblyospora modestium,NA,adipose in larvae,NA,adipose in larvae,NA,NA,NA

Amblyospora salinarian (Amblyospora salinaria),"Amblyospora salinarian. sp. (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae), Parasite of Culex salinarius (Diptera: Culicidae): Its Life Cycle Stages in an Intermediate Host. Horizontal transmission testing with an Amblyospora species from the mosquito Culex salinarius has documented the involvement of a copepod intermediate host. Meiospores (one type of uninucleate spore) of the Amblyospora sp. were infectious per os to female Macrocyclops albidus adults. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei (were haplophasic), starting with the sporoplasms from the meiospore, continuing as a succession of schizonts undergoing binary division and ending with sporulation, producing a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of M. albidus,were lanceolate, slightly curved and measured 13.23 × 3.85 μm. They infected C. salinarius larvae, both male and female, when ingested. In addition, cross-infectivity testing was conducted and demonstrated that while A. californica from C. tarsalis will infect C. salinarius,it does not complete its life cycle in this host. Based on these findings, we conclude that Amblyospora sp. from Culex salinariusis a distinct species and assign it the name Amblyospora salinarian.

An Amblyospora species (microspora, Abblyosporidae) collected in the southeast region of Austria was examined using light and electron microscopic methods. The hosts were larvae of Eusimulium costatum (Diptera, Simuliidae). The merogonial stages were found to be diplocaryotic. During sporogony, eight monocaryotic spores developed in a sporophorous vesicle. The truncate spores measured between 2.9×2.3 and 4.1×3.2 μm and had an anisofilar polar tube, the narrow part of which was rather short. Besides tubules and homogeneous, electron-dense inclusions, unique filamentous structures were observed in the episporontal space.

A new species of Amblyospora, a parasite found in wild populations of the predacious Australian mosquito Culex halifaxi, was investigated with light and electron microscopy. This species was found to be heterosporous with two concurrent sporulation sequences in the host larvae, both arising from diplokaryotic meronts and ending with haploid spores. One sequence was dominant and involved meiosis to produce eight thick‐walled, broadly oval meiospores in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). The other sequence involved nuclear dissociation to produce lanceolate, thin‐walled spores in a subpersistent SV. Horizontal transmission to the mosquito host, by one or both of two distinctly different pathways (one via an intermediate host, the other by cannibalism of infected individuals) and by vertical transmission, are postulated but have not been demonstrated.

Ameson herrnkindi,"Characterization of microsporidian Ameson herrnkindi sp. nov. infecting Caribbean spiny lobsters Panulirus argus. The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus supports a large and valuable fishery in the Caribbean Sea. In 2007-2008, a rare microsporidian parasite with spore characteristics typical of the Ameson genus was detected in 2 spiny lobsters from southeast Florida (FL). However, the parasite species was not confirmed by molecular analyses. To address this deficiency, reported here are structural and molecular data on single lobsters displaying comparable ‘cotton-like’ abdominal muscle containing ovoid microsporidian spores found at different locations in FL in 2014 and 2018 and in Saint Kitts and Nevis Islands in 2017. In the lobster from 2014, multiple life stages consistent with an Ameson-like monokaryotic microsporidian were detected by transmission electron microscopy. A partial (1228 bp) small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequence showed each microsporidia to be identical and positioned it closest phylogenetically to Ameson pulvis in a highly supported clade also containing A. michaelis, A. metacarcini, A. portunus, and Nadelspora canceri.

Ameson metacarcini,"Ameson metacarcini sp. nov. (Microsporidia) infecting the muscles of Dungeness crabs Metacarcinus magister from British Columbia, Canada. The Dungeness crab Metacarcinus magister supports a large and valuable fishery along the west coast of North America. Since 1998, Dungeness crabs exhibiting pink- to orange-colored joints and opaque white musculature have been sporadically observed in low prevalence from the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada. We provide histological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence that this condition is caused by a new microsporidian parasite. Crabs displaying gross symptoms were confirmed to have heavy infections of ovoid-shaped microsporidian spores (~1.8 × 1.4 µm in size) within muscle bundles of the skeletal musculature. The parasite apparently infected the outer periphery of each muscle bundle, and then proliferated into the muscle fibres near the centre of each infected bundle. Light infections were observed in heart tissues, and occasionally spores were observed within the fixed phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple life stages of a monokaryotic microsporidian parasite within the sarcoplasm of muscle fibres. Molecular analysis of partial small subunit rRNA sequence data from the new species revealed an affinity to Ameson, a genus of Microsporidia infecting marine crustaceans. Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species is distinct from Nadelspora canceri, a related microsporidian that also infects the muscles of this host. At present, little is known about the distribution, seasonality, and transmission of A. metacarcini in M. magister.",Ameson metacarcini,Metacarcinus magister,Sarcoplasm of skeletal myofibrils; rarely in cardiac muscles; fixed phagocytes of hemal vessels.,NA,Sarcoplasm of skeletal myofibrils; rarely in cardiac muscles; fixed phagocytes of hemal vessels.,NA,skeletal musculature; heart tissues; phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas,NA
Andreanna caspii,"Molecular and ultrastructural characterization of Andreanna caspii n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae), a parasite of Ochlerotatus caspius (Diptera: Culicidae). Abstract A new genus and species of microsporidia, Andreanna caspii n. gen., n. sp. is described from the mosquito, Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas) based on ultrastructural morphology, developmental characteristics, and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Parasite development is confined to fat body tissue and infected larvae appear swollen with dull white masses within the thorax and abdomen. Meronts have diplokaryotic nuclei and are delineated by a simple plasmalemma contiguous with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony occurs by synchronous binary division followed by cytokinesis. Diplokaryotic sporonts undergo meiosis and synchronous nuclear division forming sporogonial plasmodia with two, four and eight nuclei enclosed within a persistent sporophorous vesicle. Cytokinesis of sporogonial plasmodia results in the formation of eight uninucleate spores. The episporontal space of early sporonts is filled with a homogeneous accumulation of electron dense granular inclusions and ovoid vesicles of various dimensions, transforming into an interwoven matrix during the initial phase of sporogenesis. Spores are oval, uninucleate and measure 4.8±0.3×3.1±0.4μm (fixed). The spore wall is 260μm thick with an irregular exospore consisting of two layers (150–170μm) and a thinner endospore (90–100μm). The anchoring disk is well developed and is contiguous with a lamellar polaroplast that occupies the anterior third of the spore and possess more narrow lamellae on the posterior end. The polar filament is gradually tapered and arranged in a single row consisting of six coils ranging from 180 to 150μm in diameter. The posterior vacuole (posterosome) is moderately sized and filled with a matrix of moderate electron density. Phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA from A. caspii and 30 other species of microsporidia including 11 genera parasitic in mosquitoes using maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods showed A. caspii to be a sister group to the clade containing all of the Amblyospora species, including Culicospora, Edhazardia and Intrapredatorus, as well as Culicosporella and Hyalinocysta thus providing strong support for establishment of Andreanna as a separate genus.",Andreanna caspii,Ochlerotatus caspius,adipose,NA,adipose,NA,fat body tissue,NA
Anisofilariata chironomi,"Ultrastructure and molecular phylogeny of Anisofilariata chironomi g.n. sp.n. (Microsporidia: Terresporidia) from Chironomus plumosus L. (Diptera: Chironomidae). Larvae of Chironomus plumosus, collected in North-Western Russia in September 2008, were infected with a microsporidium possessing broadly oval uninucleate spores in sporophorous vesicles. Sporogony and spore ultrastructure of this microsporidium differed from that of known microsporidian species, suggesting establishment of a new species, Anisofilariata chironomi, being a type species of a new genus. Sporogony di-, tetra-, octo-, and 16-sporoblastic. Fixed and stained spores are 4.7-6.8 x 3.4-5.4 microm in size, the spore measurements varying depending upon the number of spores in the sporophorous vesicle. The polaroplast is bipartite, with anterior and posterior parts composed of very thin and thick lamellae, respectively, and occupies the major volume of the spore. The polar filament is anisofilar, with two broad proximal and 10-13 narrow distal coils arranged in 2-4 layers. The sporophorous vesicle is bounded by a thin membrane and contains multiple tubular structures.

Anncaliia meligethi (= Nosema meligethi) (1),"Nosema meligethi I. & R. (Microsporida) in populations of meligethes spp. in Europe. Samples of rape blossom beetles, Meligethes spp., from 12 countries in Eastern and Western Europe were inspected for the occurrence of Nosema meligethi L & R. infection. From most countries about a dozen samples and a few hundred beetles were inspected. A total of 13 910 individual beetles were checked under a compound microscope, and of these, 561 were found to be infected (4.03%). Despite careful examination, infection was not detectable in samples from the UK (1039 beetles inspected), Germany (694), Sweden (489), or Switzerland (280). One infected beetle was found among 444 beetles inspected from Austria, and one from Denmark (1/85). In contrast, the parasite was found rather regularly in samples from Finland and from Eastern European countries. No obvious reason for this pattern of infection is known, but pesticide usage at or close to the sampling sites may play a role, because most samples from which Nosema was detected originated from areas where few pesticides are used. Spore size measurements were made from seven N. meligethi isolates, and they appeared relatively uniform. It appears that artificial spread of the disease might be worthwhile in an effort towards the integrated control of M. aeneus F.",Nosema meligethi,NA,fat body; muscles,rarely,fat body; muscles,rarely,NA,NA
Antonospora psocopterae,"New microsporidia parasitizing bark lice (Insecta: Psocoptera). Abstract Two species of bark lice, Xanthocaecilius sommermanae Mockford and Polypsocus corruptus Hagen, collected in a canopy Malaise trap placed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park as part of a survey of the park’s fauna, were found to be infected with microsporidia. Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data. The finding that samples fixed and stored for months in propylene glycol (“antifreeze”) are good enough for DNA sequence analysis and can be used for morphological analyses (if no better fixation alternatives are available), is promising for future surveys for microsporidia.",Antonospora psocopterae,Xanthocaecilius sommermanae; Polypsocus corruptus,Adipose,NA,Adipose,NA,NA,NA
Antonospora scoticae,"Morphological and molecular characterization of Antonospora scoticae n. gen., n. sp. (Protozoa, microsporidia) a parasite of the communal bee, Andrena scotica Perkins, 1916 (Hymenoptera, andrenidae). The new microsporidium Antonospora scoticae n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of the communal bee Andrena scotica, is described based on light microscopy, ultrastructural characteristics and the nucleotide sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA coding region. The parasite is apansporoblastic and develops in close contact with the host cytoplasm. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Cytoplasmic fission was not observed, but the sporogony is believed to be disporoblastic. Live spores are ovocylindrical, straight to slightly curved, and measure 6.8 x 2.7 μm whereas spores fixed and stained for TEM measure 5.0 x 1.8 υm. The exospore is four-layered, with an internal single layer followed by a thicker, more electron dense layer, then another single layer followed by a thin external double layer. The polar filament is isofilar and arranged in 15-22 coils in the posterior and mid-part of the spore. The polaroplast has tightly packed lamellae that become less densely packed in the posterior region. The coding region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA is 1371 base pairs long. Its GC content (62%) is significantly higher than previously reported for this group of organisms. The systematic position of the described microsporidium was found to be ambiguous and is discussed in the context of inconsistencies between the molecular and morphological taxonomy of microsporidia. A new genus is proposed for A. scoticae without defining superior taxa because the current developmental and morphological evidence is limited and partly contradictory to the molecular data. Current taxonomies of microsporidia are based on characters that are most likely polyphyletic in nature. Traditional systems of microsporidian taxonomy may need to be extensively revised, as molecular data become available.",Antonospora scoticae,Andrena scotica,adipose tissue; haemolymph; haemocoel,NA,adipose tissue; haemolymph; haemocoel,NA,NA,NA
Apotaspora heleios,"A new microsporidium, Apotaspora heleios n. g., n. sp., from the Riverine grass shrimp Palaemonetes paludosus (Decapoda: Caridea: Palaemonidae). We report a new microsporidium from a key species of the estuarine communities of the Gulf States, the Riverine grass shrimp, Palaemonetes paludosus. A milky-white shrimp was found in the Mobile Bay Delta, a large, oligohaline-freshwater wetland in Alabama, USA. Light microscopy of smears and thick sections of the abdominal tissues demonstrated infection with microsporidian spores enclosed in sporophorous vesicles (SVs) in sets of eight. Broadly oval spores measured 2.9 ± 0.06 × 1.7 ± 0.03 µm (2.5–3.3 × 1.6–1.9 µm, n = 11). SVs with a persistent membrane ranged from 4.4 to 5.6 µm in diameter. Subcuticular epithelium and underlying musculature were packed with sporonts, sporoblasts, and spores. Electron microscopy demonstrated diplokaryotic meronts that gave rise to sporont mother cells with a large single nucleus. The meront plasma membrane turned into a SV envelope, and the sporont wall segregated internally. The sporont nucleus underwent meiosis followed by two mitotic divisions accompanied by internal budding to produce four sporonts, each dividing in two uninucleate sporoblasts. Eight-spore SVs were filled with fibrillary-tubular secretions. Spores possessed 90–110-nm thick envelopes (exospore, 40–60 nm + endospore, 30–50 nm), a triangle-shaped nucleus, isofilar polar filament of 10–13 coils arranged in two-three rows, bipartite polaroplast, and a mushroom-shaped polar disk. The SSU rDNA sequence of the novel species was deposited in GenBank under Accession number MG 708238. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Riverine grass shrimp microsporidium was a new species and placed it in one branch with two species of Potaspora, xenoma-forming microsporidia from freshwater perciform fishes. Because morphological and developmental characters of the novel species did not fit the diagnosis of the genus Potaspora, and, based on SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, different host specificity, pathogenesis, and ecological considerations, we erect here the new genus Apotaspora for the Riverine grass shrimp microsporidium and name the new species Apotaspora heleios. Grouping together fish and crustacean parasites on SSU rDNA phylogenetic trees suggests that polyxenous life cycles might be a common feature of extinct and/or extant members of the studied lineage of the Microsporidia.",Apotaspora heleios,Palaemonetes paludosus,muscles; subcuticular epithelium,NA,muscles,NA,musculature,NA
Bacillidium vesiculoformis,"Ultrastructural and molecular characterization of Bacillidium vesiculoformis n. sp. (Microspora: Mrazekiidae) in the freshwater oligochaete Nais simplex (Oligochaeta: Naididae). The development of a new species, Bacillidium vesiculoformis n. sp. (Microspora, Mrazekiidae), is described from the freshwater oligochaete Nais simplex (Oligochaeta, Naididae). Initial stages of parasite development consist of a monokaryotic merogony within a haemocyte of the intestinal blood sinus. The resulting hypertrophied haemocyte is attached to the chloragocytes of the sinus by fine cytoplasmic extensions with the sinus around the cell becoming greatly enlarged. The meronts within the haemocyte form diplokaryotic sporonts that undergo sporogenesis directly within the cytoplasm of the host cell. The infected cell becomes packed with spores and developmental stages, causing it dramatically to increase in size, eventually rupturing the oligochaete and cell. Sporogony appears to be disporoblastic. Released spores were observed to have an adhesive quality. Transmission studies conducted with mature spores failed to transmit the parasite horizontally although vertical transmission was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of the parasite demonstrated that B. vesiculoformis clustered with microsporidian parasites of bryozoa and two other microsporidians, Janacekia debaiseuxi and an unidentified Bacillidium sp.",Bacillidium vesiculoformis,Nais simplex,haemocytes,NA,haemocytes,NA,haemocyte,NA
Baculea daphniae (1),"Etude ultrastructurale de la microsporidie Baculea daphniae n.g., n. sp., parasite de l’epithelium intestinal de Daphnia pulex Leydig, 1860 (Crustace, cladocere). A new microsporidian BACULEA daphniae, parasitic in the digestive tract of D. pulex is described using an EM. The whole life cycle develops inside a parasitic vacuole. Schizogonic and sporogonic nuclei never occur in diplokaryon arrangement. After nuclear divisions the schizonts develop into uninucleate cells, the sporonts. The sporonts in their turn divide to give at least 2 sporoblasts without any intermediate plasmodial stage. The number of spores inside the parasitiophorous vacuole depends directly on the number of sporonts produced by schizogonic plasmodia. Throughout sporoblastogenesis and sporogenesis, the parasite lengthens considerably, forming thin rod-shaped spores measuring 2.8-3 .mu.m long .times. 0.2 .mu.m in diameter. The spore is uninucleate and contains a polar filament reduced to its proximal portion, the manubrium, and a special polaroplast beside it. The systemic position of B. daphniae is discussed. Comparison with Encephalitozoon Levaditi et al, 1923, emend. Sprague and Vernick, 1971, and Glugea Thelohan, 1891 emend. Sprague and Vernick, 1971, shows that Baculea differs more in features of its life cycle than in its spore structure.",Baculea daphniae,Daphnia pulex,intestinal epithelium,NA,intestinal epithelium,NA,digestive tract,NA
Becnelia sigarae,"Becnelia sigarae gen. n., sp. n. Isolated from testes of the water boatmen, Sigara lateralis (Heteroptera: Corixidae) in the Czech Republic. A microsporidian Becnelia sigarae gen. n., sp. n. (Microspora: Amblyosporidae) was isolated from testes of a water boatman Sigara lateralis (Heteroptera: Corixidae) near Bavorov, South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The life cycle of the pathogen includes a merogony with uninucleate stages, a meiotic sequence in part with binucleate stages (diplokarya) and a sporogony resulting in a persistent sporophorous vesicle containing eight spores. Spores are long oval, slightly curved, with broader basis and equally rounded ends, 5 ± 0.5 x 2.5 ± 0.5 μm in diameter. A series ending with early spores serving for autoinfection in the primary host and spread of the infection in other tissues differs in ultrastructure of spores. They are shorter and more constricted apically and measure 4 x 2.5 ± 3 μm. Both spore types have a polaroplast with a central part with multiple broad chambers enclosed anteriorly and posteriorly in circular layers of dense lamellae. The spore wall of both types is characterized by a thin exospore and an endospore of equal thickness all over the spore with exception of the attenuated apical pole. Mature spores have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 - 11 turns with first 5 - 6 broader turns and 4 - 5 narrower turns. The early spores have the filament coiled in 7 turns, of which 4 are broader and 3 narrower. All characteristics of the new microsporidium reveal that it is similar to different Amblyosporidae and we therefore propose to include it into this family. The new genus Becnelia is proposed with B. sigarae as a type species. The taxonomic position as well as the relationships to other microsporidia described from Heteroptera are discussed.",Becnelia sigarae,Sigara lateralis,testicular,NA,testicular,NA,testes,NA
Berwaldia singularis (1),"A New Microsporidium Berwaldia Singularis Gen. et Sp.Nov. from Daphnia Pulex and a Survey of Microsporidia Described from Cladocera. A new microsporidian parasite of a freshwater cladoceran from southern Sweden is described using light and electron microscopical methods. Development comprises 2 merogonial sequences, the first resulting in a cluster of 8 merozoites, the second in a chain of 4 merozoites. Each secondary merozoite develops into a sporont which divides into 2 sporoblasts, each of which develops into a spore. The spores are broadly oval and in fresh smears measure about 6 fim in length, with a single nucleus and a posterosome. The polar filament is about 40 fim long, of even thickness throughout, and appears as 15—18 coils in a single layer. The anchoring disc is small and the polaroplast is composed of 2 lamellar parts. Outside the plasma membrane of the sporont a 5-layered, electrondense substance is produced, which further differentiates into endo- and exospore, an electron-dense substance occurring patchily on the exospore and a pansporoblast membrane. During development the sporoblasts and the young spores are connected by a dense substance. Mature spores appear single or paired. The pansporoblast membrane is composed of 2 structurally different layers, namely a thin outer, single membrane and an inner layer composed of tubular structures. It is connected to the spore coat by patches of the dense substance. The new microsporidium is considered to belong to a new genus of the family Telomyxidae, and its systematic relationship with this and the related family Tuzetiidae is discussed. A survey of microsporidia from Cladocera is included.",Berwaldia singularis,Daphnia pulex,adipose tissue; hematocoel,NA,adipose tissue; hematocoel,NA,NA,NA
Binucleata daphniae,"Morphology, Molecular Phylogeny, and Ecology of Binucleata daphniae n. g., n. sp. (Fungi: Microsporidia), a Parasite of Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 (Crustacea: Branchiopoda). ABSTRACT . We describe a new microsporidian species Binucleata daphniae, n. g., n. sp., that infects the integument cells lining the hemocoele cavity of the carapace and the postabdomen of the cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus. Infected cells filled with spores accumulate as large clusters in the carapace cavity and heavily infected hosts are detected by their opaque appearance. Despite the parasite's presence, infected Daphnia grow and molt, but have a reduced fecundity. During the parasite's life cycle, chain-like meronts with isolated nuclei are formed, giving rise to binucleate presporonts, the most frequently observed, characteristic developmental stage. In sporogony, the nuclei of the presporont separate, divide, and eight spores enclosed in a thin-walled sporophorous vesicle are formed. Spores are 4.9 × 2.5 μm in size (fresh) and have an anisofilar polar filament with eight coils. DNA sequence analysis places B. daphniae in a clade of microsporidians that parasitize crustaceans and mosquitoes and have assumed complex life cycles. Binucleata daphniae, however, has a simple and direct life cycle and can be transferred to naïve hosts and maintained as persistent infections in populations of its host D. magna. We propose that B. daphniae has simplified its life cycle by losing its secondary host, rendering it unique in this clade.",Binucleata daphniae,Daphnia magna,integumentary,NA,integumentary,NA,integument cells,NA
Binucleospora elongata,"Description of Binucleospora elongata gen. et sp. nov.

The microsporidium Binucleospora elongata n.g., n. sp., a parasite of ostracods of the genus Candona in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Rounded merogonial Plasmodia produce at least 8 diplokaryotic merozoites by plasmotomy. Sporogonial Plasmodia, with 16–32 diplokarya, are initially rounded, but the shape changes to ribbon-like prior to the release of sporoblasts. The close association between the nuclei breaks at the end of the sporogony. The fragile sporophorous vesicle breaks when the spores are mature. The binucleate spores are rod-shaped, slightly curved, and measure approximately 2 × 5-6.8 μm in living condition. The exospore is two-layered with an internal double membrane-like layer and a cover of granular material. The isofilar polar filament is arranged in 11–14 irregular coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has three regions: narrow, closely packed lamellae anteriorly, wider lamellae in the median region, and posterior tubuli. The nuclei are enveloped in multiple layers of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The microsporidium is compared to the microsporidia of Ostracoda, and its possible relations to the genera Octosporea, Pseudopleistophora and Perezia are discussed. The new genus is provisionally included in the family Caudosporidae.",Binucleospora elongata,NA,adipose tissue; conective tissue; haemocytes,NA,adipose tissue; conective tissue; haemocytes,NA,NA,NA

It infects most tissues of adult male and female mosquitoes, destroying the midgut, Malpighian tubules, the fat body, muscles, hypoderm and connective tissues. It is usually transmitted with feces released by mosquitoes during feeding on cotton swabs with honey water. In sporogony the oval binucleate spores, 2.5-3 x 1.5-2 μm, have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 coils in one row. Five anterior coils are of larger diameter than the posterior three to four.

Brachiola vesicularum,"Brachiola vesicularum, n. g., n. sp., a new microsporidium associated with AIDS and myositis. Brachiola vesicularum, n. g., n. sp., is a new microsporidum associated with AIDS and myositis. Biopsied muscle tissue, examined by light and electron microscopy, revealed the presence of organisms developing in direct contact with muscle cell cytoplasm and fibers. No other tissue types were infected. All parasite stages contain diplokaryotic nuclei and all cell division is by binary fission. Sporogony is disporoblastic, producing 2.9 x 2 microns diplokaryotic spores containing 8-10 coils of the polar filament arranged in one to three rows, usually two. Additionally, this microsporidium produces electron-dense extracellular secretions and vesiculotubular appendages similar to Nosema algerae. However, the production of protoplasmic extensions which may branch and terminate in extensive vesiculotubular structures is unique to this parasite. Additionally, unlike Nosema algerae, its development occurred at warm blooded host temperature (37-38 degrees C) and unlike Nosema connori, which disseminates to all tissue types, B. vesicularum infected only muscle cells. Thus, a new genus and species is proposed. Because of the similarities with the genus Nosema, this new genus is placed in the family Nosematidae. Successful clearing of this infection (both clinically and histologically) resulted from treatment with albendazole and itraconozole.",Brachiola vesicularum,NA,striated muscles,NA,striated muscles,NA,muscle cells,NA

Ciliatosporidium platyophryae,"Ciliatosporidium platyophryae nov. gen., nov. spec. (Microspora incerta sedis), a parasite of Platyophrya terricola (Ciliophora, Colpodea). Ciliatosporidium platyophryae nov. gen., nov. spec, is a microsporidian parasite affecting the soil ciliate Cirrophrya terricola Foissner, 1987. It was found in a soil sample from Utah (USA), pure cultures were not available. The developmental stages seen are uninucleate and divide by binary fission (disporoblastic). Each sporont is enveloped by a membranelike exospore precursor and a parasitophorous vacuole deriving from host endoplasmic reticulum and persisting during spore maturation. The spore is rod-shaped with hemispherical ends and measures about 4×2 μm. It has a short, uncoiled polar filament and conspicuous, possibly transient sacs in the wide anterior lamellae of the bipartite polaroplast. The exospore has the appearance of a unit membrane. Maturing spores induce the formation of appendages (“feet”) at the posterior end of the host which was thus formerly assigned to the genus Cirrophrya. However, our study shows that the feet are a pathological phenomenon and the host thus belongs to the genus Platyophrya: Platyophrya terricola (Foissner, 1987) nov. comb. Despite its unusual host, the fine structure of C. platyophryae is very similar to that of microsporidia from other invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Very likely, C. platyophryae is related to the genera Oligosporidium, Encephalitozoon, Unikaryon and Endoreticulatus, presently assigned to the families Encephalitozoonidae and/or Unikaryonidae. However, for a definite classification of C. platyophryae more detailed data on its life cycle and membranous envelopes are necessary.

In genital ducts of females oval cylindrical thin-walled spores of 6.3-8.7 X 2.5-3.7 microns are formed. C. cadyrovi sp. n. from Culex pipiens forms spores of 5.6-6.8 X 3.7-5.0 microns in larvae. After the fixation the poles do not become flattened, plumes are equal, with narrow base. The second type of spores has not been discovered. C. aedis sp. n. from Aedes caspius has spores of 6.2-7.5 X 4.3-5.6 microns in larvae. Plumes with narrow base, the anterior and posterior ones are different in shape.

Cucumispora ornata,"Cucumispora ornata n. sp. (Fungi: Microsporidia) infecting invasive ‘demon shrimp’ (Dikerogammarus haemobaphes) in the United Kingdom. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, the ‘demon shrimp’, is an amphipod native to the Ponto-Caspian region. This species invaded the UK in 2012 and has become widely established. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes has the potential to introduce non-native pathogens into the UK, creating a potential threat to native fauna. This study describes a novel species of microsporidian parasite infecting 72.8% of invasive D. haemobaphes located in the River Trent, UK. The microsporidium infection was systemic throughout the host; mainly targeting the sarcolemma of muscle tissues. Electron microscopy revealed this parasite to be diplokaryotic and have 7–9 turns of the polar filament. The microsporidium is placed into the ‘Cucumispora’ genus based on host histopathology, fine detail parasite ultrastructure, a highly similar life-cycle and SSU rDNA sequence phylogeny. Using this data this novel microsporidian species is named Cucumispora ornata, where ‘ornata’ refers to the external beading present on the mature spore stage of this organism. Alongside a taxonomic discussion, the presence of a novel Cucumispora sp. in the United Kingdom is discussed and related to the potential control of invasive Dikerogammarus spp. in the UK and the health of native species which may come into contact with this parasite.",Cucumispora ornata,Dikerogammarus haemobaphes,muscles; connective tissue; nervous system; carapace,between the gut and gonad,muscles; connective tissue; nervous system; carapace,between the gut and gonad,muscle tissues,NA
Cucumispora roeselii,"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii. BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",Cucumispora roeselii,Gammarus roeselii,muscle,NA,muscle,NA,NA,NA
Cystosporogenes deliaradicae,"Ultrastructural study and description of Cystosporogenes deliaradicae n. sp. (microspora, glugeidae), a microsporidian parasite of the cabbage root fly Delia radicum (Linnaeus, 1758) (diptera, anthomyidae). The microsporidium Cystosporogenes deliaradicae sp. no v., a parasite of the adipose tissue of adult cabbage root flies, Delia radicum in Denmark, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 4–16 (most commonly 6 or 8) ovocylindrical spores, measuring 1.2–1.5 × 4.6–5.5 μm when fixed and stained. The spore wall has an approximately 43 nm thick, layered exospore with a median layer resembling a double membrane. The polaroplast is uniformly lamellar. The isofilar, 114–123 nm thick, polar filament is arranged in 11–15 (most commonly 12–13) coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt is approximately 35°. The last coil touches the posterior pole of the spore. A sporophorous vesicle is produced by the sporont. The envelope is generated as a duplication of the plasma membrane. Typically the vesicle primordia grow from one pole of the sporont to the other. The episporontal space initially has granular inclusions. Later septate, persistent tubules of exospore material appear. Simultaneously with the release of sporoblasts, wide tubulus-like, non-persistent structures are formed. They are covered by regularly spaced electron-dense material. Anomalous sporogony was frequently observed, probably caused by a simultaneous parasitism by the fungus Strongwellsea castrans. The systematic position of the microsporidium is discussed, including the reasons for incorporating the genus into the family Glugeidae",Cystosporogenes deliaradicae,Delia radicum,fat body,close to hypoderm,fat body,close to hypoderm,NA,NA
Cystosporogenes sp.,"Morphology, molecular characteristics and prevalence of a Cystosporogenes species (Microsporidia) isolated from Agrilus anxius (Coleoptera: Buprestidae). A microsporidium was isolated from the bronze birch borer, Agrilus anxius Gory (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), collected near Sudbury and Sault Ste Marie, Canada. Light and electron microscopic investigations showed that gross pathology and ultrastructure of the investigated Cystosporogenes species was similar to those characterized and described for other Cystosporogenes species. Small subunit rRNA gene sequence data and comparative phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the microsporidian species from A. anxius is most closely related to the genus Cystosporogenes clade of microsporidia. Infection average in the Sudbury and Sault Ste Marie beetle populations was >80% and relatively stable in 2006–2007 but declined in 2008. Field prevalence of the A. anxius isolate, mechanisms that may potentially be involved in its horizontal (autoinfection) and vertical (transovarial) transmission, and disease dynamics are discussed.

Desmozoon lepeophtherii (also Paranucleospora theridion) (1),"A hyperparasitic microsporidian infecting the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis: an rDNA-based molecular phylogenetic study. The sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is an obligate ectoparasitic copepod that lives on the external surface of salmonid fish. It is the most common ectoparasite of marine cage-reared salmonids, causing major economic loss to the aquaculture industry. During a sea louse monitoring programme, samples of L. salmonis were found to harbour an unreported microsporidian parasite. The microsporidian was observed in pre-adult and adult stages of both male and female copepods, with a prevalence of up to 5%. Unfixed spores were slightly pyriform in shape measuring 2.34 μm by 1.83 μm (±0.01 μm) and were not observed to be enclosed by a sporophorous vesicle. The microsporidian infection was observed in all areas of the copepods’ body, xenoma-like cysts forming directly under the cuticle in the epidermal tissue layer. In the present study, rDNA (530f–580r) sequence data gathered from the unidentified microsporidian parasite isolated from infected sea lice were compared with equivalents available in the databases in an attempt to identify its systematic position. The microsporidian was found to group within the phylogenetic clade containing the family Enterocytozoonidae, being most similar to members of the intranuclear genus Nucleospora.

Dictyocoela diporeiae,"Molecular and ultrastructural characterization of Dictyocoela diporeiae n. sp. (Microsporidia), a parasite of Diporeia spp. (Amphipoda, Gammaridea). Dictyocoela diporeiae n. sp. is described from Diporeia spp. (Amphipoda, Gammaridea) collected from Lake Superior (USA), and its morphology and taxonomic affiliation are discussed. In hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of infected amphipods, the microsporidian was observed to infect muscle tissue surrounding the ovaries. Melanized hemocytic encapsulations were often observed in or near masses of microsporidians. The microsporidians appeared as spores measuring 1.99 ± 0.09 μm long by 1.19 ± 0.05 μm wide. Each spore contained eight coils of isofilar polar filaments that were arranged in single ranks. Polar filaments measured 71 ± 3 nm in diameter. A prominent lamellar polaroplast composed of ordered concentric membranes was found at the apical end of the spore surrounding the polar filament. A distinct posterior vacuole was observed at the distal end of the spore. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16s RNA sequences showed that the microsporidian belongs to the genus Dictyocoela, and is most similar to D. berillonum, yet distinctly different. The species is new, based on its morphology, genetic sequence, host, and location within the host.",Dictyocoela diporeiae,Amphipoda; Gammaridea; Diporeia spp.,Muscle surrounding ovaries,NA,Muscle surrounding ovaries,NA,muscle tissues (Diporeia spp.),NA
Dictyocoela duebenum (1),"Infection of Gammarus duebeni populations by two vertically transmitted microsporidia; parasite detection and discrimination by PCR-RFLP. We screened a population of the brackish water crustacean Gammarus duebeni from the Isle of Cumbrae for the presence of vertically transmitted microsporidia. We compared 2 screening techniques; light microscopy and PCR-based detection using generic 16S rDNA microsporidian primers. Fifty percent of females from this population tested positive for vertically transmitted microsporidia. The PCR screen was 100% efficient in comparison with existing LM based screening. In addition, the PCR screen produced bands of 2 sizes suggesting that more than 1 species of microsporidian was present. Sequencing revealed 2 distinct species of vertically transmitted microsporidia; 33% of females were infected with the feminizer Nosema granulosis and 17% were infected with a new species which we provisionally designate Microsporidium sp. On the basis of sequence information, we developed a discriminatory PCR-RFLP test based on MspI and HaeIII digests. This screen allows rapid detection and discrimination of vertically transmitted microsporidia in natural field populations. We applied the PCR-RFLP screen to a second G. duebeni population from the Isle of Man. This population also hosted these 2 parasite species. In total 45% of females harboured N. granulosis and 10% harboured Microsporidium sp. No dual-infected individuals were found in either population. The occurrence of 2 vertically transmitted parasites within a population has implications for our understanding of parasite-host relationships in the field and we discuss factors affecting the dynamics of parasite-parasite competition and coexistence.",NA,Gammarus duebeni,egg; ovarian,NA,egg; ovarian,NA,NA,NA
Dictyocoela roeselum (1),"Coexistence of three microsporidia parasites in populations of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeseli: evidence for vertical transmission and positive effect on reproduction. We investigated the prevalence, transmission mode and fitness effects of infections by obligatory intracellular, microsporidian parasites in the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeseli. We found three different microsporidia species in this host, all using transovarial (vertical) transmission. All three coexist at different prevalences in two host populations, but bi-infected individuals were rarely found, suggesting no (or very little) horizontal transmission. It is predicted that vertically-transmitted parasites may exhibit sex-specific virulence in their hosts, or they may have either positive or neutral effects on host fitness. All three species differed in their transmission efficiency and infection intensity and our data suggest that these microsporidia exert sex-specific virulence by feminising male hosts. The patterns of infection we found exhibit convergent evolution with those of another amphipod host, Gammarus duebeni. Interestingly, we found that infected females breed earlier in the reproductive season than uninfected females. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to report a positive effect of microsporidian infection on female host reproduction.",NA,Gammarus roeseli,egg; ovarian,NA,egg; ovarian,NA,NA,NA
Duboscqia dengihilli,"Life cycle of a new species of Duboscqia (Microsporida: Thelohaniidae) infecting the mosquito Anopheles hilli and an intermediate copepod host, Apocyclops dengizicus. A new species of Microsporida, Duboscqia dengihilli, was found infecting larvae of the mosquito Anopheles hilli in northern Queensland, Australia. Laboratory experiments showed that binucleate spores formed within infected female mosquitoes were responsible for transovarial transmission to the next generation. Sporogony within the larval fat body was initiated by two diplokarya, one at each end of the cell, which undergo meiosis within a single sporophorous vesicle to form 16 meiospores. These spores are responsible for horizontal transmission to the copepod Apocyclops dengizicus. The microsporidium is transmitted back to the mosquito host via uninucleate pyriform spores formed within the copepod host which are infectious to larvae of A. hilli. The meronts within larvae infected by horizontal transmission ultimately develop into the binucleate spores within adult females to complete the life cycle. Thus, the development of this microsporidium involves vertical transmission between successive mosquito generations and horizontal transmission between mosquitoes and copepods similar to the life cycles of Amblyospora and Parathelohania.",Duboscqia dengihilli,Anopheles hilli; Apocyclops dengizicus,fat body; oenocytes,NA,oenocytes,NA,fat body (Anopheles hilli),NA

The three isolates were morphologically similar to Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The spores averaged 1 x 1.5-2.0 microns, had six to eight polar filament coils, displayed monokaryotic nuclei, and possessed relatively thick endospores with irregularly shaped exospores. Organisms developed within a parasitophorous vacuole. By SDS-PAGE analysis, the three isolates appeared to be identical but were different from E. cuniculi. Identical banding patterns on Western blots of the three isolates were expressed by each patient's serum. By Western immunoblotting, murine antisera to E. cuniculi reacted to several antigens of the new AIDS-related microsporidian, whereas murine antisera bound weakly to Nosema corneum.

Encephalitozoon intestinalis (= Septata intestinalis) (1),"Septata Intestinalis N. G., N. Sp., an Intestinal Microsporidian Associated With Chronic Diarrhea and Dissemination In Aids Patients. Intestinal microsporidiosis in patients diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and having chronic diarrhea was first reported in 1985 and the associated microsporidian was named Enterocytozoon bieneusi. the intracellular developmental cycle of E. bieneusi in enterocytes has been demonstrated and many cases have been reported worldwide. This report presents the life cycle of a second intestinal microsporidian, associated with the same symptoms, in five AIDS patients. This new microsporidian also infects enterocytes but its pathology and morphology differ from that of E. bieneusi. It involves lamina propria macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and can disseminate to infect other parts of the body, e.g. the kidney and gall bladder. the parasite cycle includes development of rounded uninucleate and elongated bi‐ or tetranucleate cells without the formation of plasmodial stages. Sporogony is similar to the more typical development of microsporidia with sporoblast morphogenesis occurring after the last cell division. the development of cells within chambers of a septate, honeycomb‐like, parasite‐secreted fibrillar network and surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole, however, is unique to this microsporidian, justifying the establishment of a new genus and species, Septata intestinalis n. g., n. sp.",Septata Intestinalis,Aids Patients,intestines; villus enterocytes; lamina propria macrophages; lamina propria fibroblasts; lamina propria endothelial cells; gall bladder epithelium; gall bladder macrophages; kidney tubular cells; kidney transitional cells; nasal mucosa,NA,intestines; villus enterocytes; lamina propria fibroblasts; lamina propria endothelial cells; gall bladder epithelium; gall bladder macrophages; kidney tubular cells; kidney transitional cells; nasal mucosa,NA,fibroblasts; endothelial cells; kidney; gall bladder,NA

Intestinal microsporidiosis was documented by detecting abundant slightly curved spores (2.9 x 1.2 microns) in the faeces of five of twelve skinks Mabuya perrotetii Duméril et Bibron, 1839 that originated from Ghana. Clinically, the microsporidiosis was characterized by decreased appetite, diarrhea, and weight loss. Histopathological changes consisted of villous atrophy, blunting of mucosa and flattening of individual epithelial cells in the large intestine. The ultrastructure of microsporidian spores was consistent with an Encephalitozoon species. The PCR-RFLP assay and the heteroduplex mobility shift analyses were used to verify that the skink microsporidian is a species of the genus Encephalitozoon Levaditi, Nicolau et Schoen, 1923 and indicate that this microsporidian is not E. hellem, E. intestinalis or a strain of E. cuniculi.

Encephalitozoon sp. 4,"LIGHT-MICROSCOPIC AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL-STUDY OF GURLEYA-LEGERI-SENSU MACKINNON (1911) WITH ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW SPECIES GURLEYA-DORISAE SP-N (MICROSPORA, GURLEYIDAE). The microsporidium Gurleya dorisae sp. n., a parasite of caddis fly larvae of the species Anabolin nervosa and Micropterna lateralis, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed.

Endoreticulatus poecilimonae,"Review of the genus Endoreticulatus (Microsporidia, Encephalitozoonidae) with description of a new species isolated from the grasshopper Poecilimon thoracicus (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) and transfer of Microsporidium itiiti Malone to the genus. The historic genus Pleistophora (Plistophora) is a highly polyphyletic clade with invertebrate Microsporidia reassigned to several new genera since the 1980s. Two genera, Endoreticulatus and Cystosporogenes, clearly separate into distinct but closely related clades based on small subunit ribosomal RNA analysis but are included in different families that are each polyphyletic. A microsporidium with morphology resembling the Endoreticulatus/Cystosporogenes clade was isolated from the grasshopper Poecilimon thoracicus from a site in Northwest Bulgaria. It produced intense infections in the digestive tract of the host but no behavioral changes were noted in infected individuals. Prevalence of the microsporidium increased over the active feeding season yearly. Mature spores were oval and measured 2.58±0.21μm×1.34±0.24μm, with 16 to approximately 32 spores in a parasitophorous vacuole. The spores were uninucleate and polar filament coils numbered 8–9 situated in a single row. The spore polaroplast consisted of an anterior lamellar section and a posterior vesicular section, and the posterior vacuole was reduced. Analyses of a 1221bp partial SSU-rRNA sequence indicated that the isolate is more closely related to the Endoreticulatus clade than to Cystosporogenes, but shows earlier phylogenetic separation from species infecting Lepidoptera and represents a new species, Endoreticulatus poecilimonae. To compare sequences of Endoreticulatus spp. from Lepidoptera to those infecting other insect orders, an isolate, Microsporidium itiiti Malone (1985), described from the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, was sequenced. Like the grasshopper isolate, the weevil isolate is closely related but basal to the lepidopteran Endoreticulatus clade. The original description combined with the new sequence data confirms species status and permits transfer of the isolate from Microsporidium, a genus erected for microsporidian species of uncertain taxonomic status, to Endoreticulatus.",Endoreticulatus poecilimonae,Poecilimon thoracicus,midgut; gastric caeca,NA,midgut; gastric caeca,NA,digestive tract,NA

Neither a sporophorous vesicle (pansporoblastic membrane) nor parasitophorous vacuole were differentiated around the developmental stages, which were in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. The polar tube (5-6 coils) was differentiated before fission of the sporogonial plasmodium. The mature spores measured 1.5 micron X 0.5 micron. The spore wall was very thin as the endospore was absent or poorly differentiated. The organism is named Enterocytozoon bieneusi n. g., n. sp. and is assigned to the suborder Apansporoblastina.",Enterocytozoon bieneusi,human,intestinal epithelium; bilary duct; nasal epithelium; gallbladder; common bile duct; intrahepatic bile duct,enterocytes,intestinal epithelium; bilary duct; nasal epithelium; gallbladder; common bile duct; intrahepatic bile duct,NA,NA,NA
Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei,"Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei sp. nov. (Microsporida: Enterocytozoonidae), a parasite of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (Decapoda: Penaeidae): Fine structure and phylogenetic relationships. Abstract A new microsporidian species, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei sp. nov., is described from the hepatopancreas of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (Crustacea: Decapoda). Different stages of the parasite are described, from early sporogonal plasmodia to mature spores in the cytoplasm of host-cells. The multinucleate sporogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm and contained numerous small blebs at the surface. Binary fission of the plasmodial nuclei occurred during early plasmodial development and numerous pre-sporoblasts were formed within the plasmodium. Electron-dense disks and precursors of the polar tubule developed in the cytoplasm of the plasmodium prior to budding of early sporoblasts from the plasmodial surface. Mature spores were oval, measuring 0.7×1.1μm and contained a single nucleus, 5–6 coils of the polar filament, a posterior vacuole, an anchoring disk attached to the polar filament, and a thick electron-dense wall. The wall was composed of a plasmalemma, an electron-lucent endospore (10nm) and an electron-dense exospore (2nm). DNA primers designed from microsporidian SSU rRNA were used to amplify an 848bp product from the parasite genome (GenBank Download FJ496356). The sequenced product had 84% identity to the matching region of SSU rRNA from Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based upon ultrastructural features unique to the family Enterocytozoonidae, cytoplasmic location of the plasmodia and SSU rRNA sequence identity 16% different from E. bieneusi, the parasite was considered to be a new species, E. hepatopenaei, within the genus Enterocytozoon.",Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei,Penaeus monodon,epithelium; hepatopancreas,NA,epithelium,NA,NA,NA
Enterocytozoon salmonis (Nucleospora salmonis) (1),"Enterocytozoon salmonis n. sp.: an intranuclear microsporidium from salmonid fish.. The developmental stages of a recently described microsporidian from the nucleus of hematopoietic cells of salmonid fish were found to be unique among the Microsporida. All observed stages, including meronts, sporonts, and spores were in direct contact with the host cell nucleus (principally hematopoietic cells) of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). There is no parasitophorous vacuole and sporogony does not involve formation of a pansporoblastic membrane as with other members of the suborder Apansporoblastina. The extrusion apparatus differentiates prior to division of sporogonial plasmodia. The spores are ovoid (1 x 2 microns) and uninucleate, and possess a coiled polar tube with 8-12 turns. Developmental stages of the salmonid microsporidian are similar to those described for Enterocytozoon bieneusi as found in the intestinal mucosa of human AIDS patients. However, the intranuclear development, different cell types, and host infected clearly separate the salmonid and human parasites. Accordingly, the intranuclear parasite of salmonids is given the name Enterocytozoon salmonis n. sp. within the suborder Apansporoblastina.",Enterocytozoon salmonis,Oncorhynchus tshawytscha,hematopoietic cells; kidney epithelium; urinary tubule epithelium; rodlet cells,NA,kidney epithelium; urinary tubule epithelium; rodlet cells,NA,NA,NA

Enteropsectra breve,"A Large Collection of Novel Nematode-Infecting Microsporidia and Their Diverse Interactions with Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Related Nematodes. Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",NA,Oscheius tipulae,intestine,does not affect intestinal cells,intestine,does not affect intestinal cells,NA,NA
Enterospora canceri,"Enterospora canceri n. gen., n. sp., intranuclear within the hepatopancreatocytes of the European edible crab Cancer pagurus. Only 1 genus (Nucleospora) within 1 family (Enterocytozoonidae) of the Microsporidia contains species that are parasitic within the nuclei of their host cells; to date, all described intranuclear Nucleospora spp. parasitise fish. This study describes the first intranuclear microsporidian parasite of an invertebrate, the European edible crab Cancer pagurus L. (Decapoda: Cancridae). Infected crabs displayed no obvious external signs, and maximum apparent prevalence of infection within a monthly sample was 3.45 %. Infected hepatopancreatic tubules were characterised by varying numbers of hypertrophic and eosinophilic nuclei within epithelial cells. Parasite stages appeared as eosinophilic granular accumulations causing margination of host chromatin. In advanced cases, the tubule epithelia degenerated, with parasites and sloughed epithelial cells appearing in tubule lumens. All life stages of the parasite were observed within host nuclei. Uninucleate meronts were not detected, although binucleate stages were observed. Multinucleate Plasmodia (sporogonal Plasmodia) contained up to 22 nuclei in section, and late-stage Plasmodia contained multiple copies of apparatus resembling the polar filament and anchoring disk, apparently associated with individual plasmodial nuclei. As such, aggregation and early assembly of sporoblast components took place within the intact sporogonial Plasmodium, a feature unique to the Enterocytozoonidae. Liberation of sporoblasts from Plasmodia or the presence of liberated sporoblasts was not observed in this study. However, large numbers of maturing and mature spores (measuring 1.3 ± 0.02 x 0.7 ± 0.01 μm) were frequently observed in direct contact with the host nucleoplasm. Considering the shared features of this parasite with microsporidians of the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the unique presence of this parasite within the nucleoplasm of decapod crustacean hepatopancreatocytes, this parasite (Enterospora canceri) is proposed as the type species of a new genus (Enterospora) of microsporidian. Molecular taxonomic work is now required, comparing Enterospora to Enterocytozoon and Nucleospora, the 2 other genera within the Enterocytozoonidae. © Inter-Research 2007.",Enterospora canceri,Cancer pagurus,epithelium,NA,epithelium,NA,epatopancreatocytes,NA
Enterospora nucleophila,"A new intranuclear microsporidium, Enterospora nucleophila n. sp., causing an emaciative syndrome in a piscine host (Sparus aurata), prompts the redescription of the family Enterocytozoonidae. Graphical abstract Highlights • A new species of microsporidium is described from the intestine of a marine teleost. • The ultrastructural and molecular analyses place it within the Enterocytozoonidae. • The Enterocytozoonidae family is amended. • Intranuclear stages are free in the nucleoplasm and those in the cytoplasm are in a parasitophorous vacuole. • This microsporidium is a potential threat for cultured fish as it drastically reduces growth. Abstract The presence of a new microsporidium is believed to be responsible for an emaciative syndrome observed in farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) from different facilities along the Spanish coast. Infected fish were approximately half the average weight and significant mortality was attributed to the condition in some facilities. Clinical signs included anorexia, cachexia and pale internal organs. The microsporidium was found mainly in the intestinal mucosa and occasionally in the submucosa. Morphological, histopathological, ultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic studies were conducted to characterise this organism. This microsporidium undergoes intranuclear development in rodlet cells and enterocytes, and cytoplasmic development mainly in enterocytes and macrophages. The nucleus-infecting plasmodium contains several diplokarya and displays polysporous development which occurs without an interfacial envelope. In the host cell cytoplasm, the parasite develops within a membrane-bound matrix. In both infection locations, the polar tube precursors appear as disks, first with lucent centres, then as fully dense disks as they fuse to form the polar filament, all before division of the plasmodium into sporoblasts. Up to 16 intranuclear spores result from the sporogonic development of a single plasmodium, whereas more than 40 spores result from several asynchronous reproductive cycles in the cytoplasmic infection. Fixed spores are ellipsoidal and diplokaryotic, with five to six coils of an isofilar polar filament in a single row. ssrDNA-based molecular phylogenetic inference places this parasite as a sister clade to crustacean-infecting species of the Enterocytozoonidae and closer to Enterocytozoon bieneusi than to other fish-infecting microsporidians presenting intranuclear development, i.e. Nucleospora, Paranucleospora and Desmozoon. Our studies result in the erection of a new species, Enterospora nucleophila, within the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the description of this family is amended accordingly to accommodate the features of known species assigned to it. Severe histopathological damage occurs in intense infections and this microsporidian is considered a serious emerging threat in sea bream production.",Enterospora nucleophila,Sparus aurata,primarily intestine; rarely in the stomach,NA,primarily intestine; rarely in the stomach,NA,intestinal mucosa; submucosa,NA

Facilispora margolisi,"The Diversity of Microsporidia in Parasitic Copepods (Caligidae: Siphonostomatoida) in the Northeast Pacific Ocean with Description of Facilispora margolisi n. g., n. sp. and a new Family Facilisporidae n. fam.. Three distinct microsporidia were identified from parasitic copepods in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a partial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequence identified a genetically distinct variety of Desmozoon lepeophtherii from Lepeophtheirus salmonis on cultured Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and this was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis resolved the SSU rDNA sequence of the second organism in a unique lineage that was most similar to microsporidia from marine and brackish water crustaceans. The second occurred in L. salmonis on Atlantic, sockeye Oncorhynchus nerka, chum O. keta and coho O. kisutch salmon, in Lepeophtheirus cuneifer on Atlantic salmon, and in Lepeophtheirus parviventris on Irish Lord Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus. Replication occurred by binary fission during merogony and sporogony, diplokarya were not present, and all stages were in contact with host cell cytoplasm. This parasite was identified as Facilispora margolisi n. g., n. sp. and accommodated within a new family, the Facilisporidae n. fam.

Fibrillanosema crangonycis,"Invasion success of Fibrillanosema crangonycis, n.sp., n.g.: A novel vertically transmitted microsporidian parasite from the invasive amphipod host Crangonyx pseudogracilis. Parasitism is known to be an important factor in determining the success of biological invasions. Here we examine Crangonyx pseudogracilis, a North American amphipod invasive in the United Kingdom and describe a novel microsporidium, Fibrillanosema crangonycis n.sp., n.g. The primary site of infection is the female gonad and the parasite is transovarially transmitted to the eggs. PCR screening reveals a female bias in the distribution of parasites (96.6% of females, N = 29; 22.2% of males, N = 27), which is indicative of host sex ratio distortion. The morphological and molecular characterisations of this new microsporidium place it outside all currently established genera. On the basis of these differences, we erect the new genus Fibrillanosema n.g. While F. crangonycis is morphologically identical to uncharacterised microsporidia from populations of North American amphipods, it is distinct from microsporidia found in European populations of amphipods. These data support the hypothesis that vertically transmitted parasites may be selectively retained during invasion events. Furthermore where vertical transmission is combined with host sex ratio distortion these parasites may directly enhance host invasion success through increased rates of population growth. © 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Fusasporis stethaprioni,"Tetra disseminated microsporidiosis: a novel disease in ornamental fish caused by Fusasporis stethaprioni n. gen. n. sp.. A novel microsporidial disease was documented in two ornamental fish species, black tetra Gymnocorymbus ternetzi Boulenger 1895 and cardinal tetra Paracheirodon axelrodi Schultz 1956. The non-xenoma-forming microsporidium occurred diffusely in most internal organs and the gill, thus referring to the condition as tetra disseminated microsporidiosis (TDM). The occurrence of TDM in black tetra was associated with chronic mortality in a domestic farmed population, while the case in cardinal tetra occurred in moribund fish while in quarantine at a public aquarium. Histology showed that coelomic visceral organs were frequently necrotic and severely disrupted by extensive infiltrates of macrophages. Infected macrophages were presumed responsible for the dissemination of spores throughout the body. Ultrastructural characteristics of the parasite developmental cycle included uninucleate meronts directly in the host cell cytoplasm. Sporonts were bi-nucleated as a result of karyokinesis and a parasite-produced sporophorous vesicle (SPV) became apparent at this stage. Cytokinesis resulted in two spores forming within each SPV. Spores were uniform in size, measuring about 3.9 ± 0.33 long by 2.0 ± 0.2 μm wide. Ultrastructure demonstrated two spore types, one with 9-12 polar filament coils and a double-layered exospore and a second type with 4-7 polar filament coils and a homogenously electron-dense exospore, with differences perhaps related to parasite transmission mechanisms. The 16S rDNA sequences showed closest identity to the genus Glugea (≈ 92%), though the developmental cycle, specifically being a non-xenoma-forming species and having two spores forming within a SPV, did not fit within the genus.

Glugea eda,"Ultrastructural description and phylogeny of a novel microsporidian, Glugea eda n. sp. from the striated fusilier, Caesio striata, in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia. Glugea eda n. sp. is described from the mesenteries of the striated fusilier, Caesio striata, collected from the Red Sea coast off Yanbu' al Bahr, Saudi Arabia. Numerous blackish xenomas, ranged from 3 to 5 mm, were found in the body cavity associated with the mesenteries. Mature spores are monomorphic, ellipsoidal with an average size of 5(4–6) μm in length and 2.2 (2–3) μm in width. Observations of the ultrastructure revealed that the development was asynchronous and that the nuclei were isolated throughout the life cycle with uninucleate meronts. Sporoblasts were uninucleated and existed together with sporonts in a fully formed parasitophorous vacuole. The polar filament of the mature spore was isofilar with 24–28 coils, arranged in three rows.

Glugea pagri,"A new species of Glugea Thélohan, 1891 in the red sea bream Pagrus major (Temminck & Schlegel) (Teleostei: Sparidae) from China. A new microsporidian species is described from farmed red sea bream Pagrus major (Temminck & Schlegel) (Teleostei: Sparidae). Large numbers of spherical whitish xenomas were observed throughout the visceral organs of the host. Histological examination showed that the microsporidia caused several xenomas that were embedded in the intestinal muscularis externa or submucosa. Light and transmission electron microscopy examination of the spores also revealed morphological features typical of species of Glugea Thélohan, 1891. This microsporidian parasite has two different types of mature spores: microspores and macrospores. The spores are elongate-ovoid, with a large posterior vacuole. The polaroplast is bi-partite, with anterior and posterior parts comprising densely packed lamellae and loose membranes, respectively, and occupies approximately the anterior half of the spore. The polar filament is anisofilar, with 12–13 coils in a single layer almost touching the posterior spore wall. Comparison of the small subunit rDNA sequences revealed 92.7–98.1% identity with the sequences available from other Glugea spp. from piscine hosts. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the microsporidian species studied clustered within the Glugea clade with strong support. Based on the differences in the morphological characteristics and molecular data, the microsporidian infecting P. major is considered to represent a species new to science, Glugea pagri n. sp.",Glugea pagri,Pagrus major,Throughout the visceral organs of infected fish,NA,Throughout the visceral organs of infected fish,NA,intestinal muscularis externa; submucosa,NA
Glugea plecoglossi,"Studies on Glugea Infection of the Ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis—I. A new species of microsporidian parasite of the ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis T. & S., is described and the name Glugea plecoglossi T. sp. is suggested. In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm. Fresh spores of the parasite are elongate or ellipsoidal and are 5.1-6.2 x 2.0-2.5µ, the average of 200 spores being 5.8 x 2.1 Spores fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Heidenhein's iron hematoxylin are 3.S-4.8 x 1.5-2.0 µ the average of 50 spores being 4.0 X 1.8 µ. Everted filaments are 180 µ at maximum, being 100-150 µ in the majority. The processes of schizogony and sporogony of the parasite studied with artificially infected ayu are in substance the same as those reported by Weissenberg (1968) on Glugea anomala and by Sprague and Yernick (1968) on G. weissenbergu A very small xenoma of 4x8 µ with a single schizont and a single host cell nucleus was found in the lamina propria of the villi of the gut of an ayu killed 5 days after infection. Sporonts in smear preparations of parasite are 3 x 4 µ and each sporont produce two spores. Therefore the parasite is classified into the genus Glugea. Inoculation experiments have shown that Salmo gairdneri is susceptible to the parasite, but. Gasterosteus acelatus microcephalus is unsusceptible. Of about 15 species of Glugea in fish, G. hertwigi has spores similar in size to those of the present Glugea, But the former differs from the latter in the following points. The hosts of G. hertwigi are Osmerus mordax and O. eperlanus and it has been reported by Weissenberg (1968) that Gasterosteus aceleatus is susceptible to G. hertwigi, G. anomala and G. weissenhergi are distinguishable in having smaller spores, 3 x 1.5-2 µ, and larger spores, 6.0-7.0 X 2.5-3.6 µ, respectively, and in having different hosts, the sticklebacks.

Hamiltosporidium magnivora (= Flabelliforma magnivora) (1),"Ultrastructural study and description of Flabelliforma magnivora sp. n. (Microspora: Duboscqiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Cladocera: Daphniidae). The new microsporidium Flabelliforma magnivora sp. n. is described based primarily on ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial and sporogonial reproductions are by rosette- or finger-like budding. The sporogony yields 4-16, most frequently 12, sporoblasts. A fragile sporophorous vesicle is formed by the sporont. Spores are lightly pyriform, with both poles blunt, often with one surface slightly convex. Unfixed spores measure 2.34-3.03 x 4.07-4.93 μm. The exospore, which is five-layered with an internal double-layer, measures 35-40 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar with 14-17, 77-94 nm wide coils arranged in two irregular layers of coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast, which ends close to the anterior polar filament coils, is composed of two regions of regularly arranged lamellae: narrow lamellae anteriorly, wider lamellae posteriorly. The host is the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The primary site of infection is the fat body, but infection was also observed in the hypodermic cells and the ovaries. In the laboratory the parasites are transmitted with nearly 100% fidelity from mother to offspring. Transversely sectioned polyribosomes appeared as characteristic circular configurations of 9 ribosomes. Teratological development, including incomplete separation of sporoblasts, macrospores with supernumerary polar filament coils, and disturbed coiling, was observed.

Heterosporis sutherlandae,"Description of the Microsporidian Parasite, Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp., Infecting Fish in the Great Lakes Region, USA. Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease worldwide, impacting wild and farmed raised fishes in both marine and freshwater environments. A previously undescribed species (Heterosporis sp.), with widespread distribution in the Great Lakes region, was the subject of this study. Three angler-caught fish were submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from 2009–2010 with lesions caused by intracellular proliferation of parasitic spores, resulting in destruction and eventual widespread necrosis of the host skeletal muscles. Mature ovoid (5.8 x 3.5μm) spores of a microsporidian parasite, consistent with the genus Heterosporis, were observed by light and electron microscopy. Molecular identification was performed using primer walking to obtain a near-complete rRNA gene sequence (~3,600 bp). A unique species of Heterosporis was identified, demonstrating less than 96% sequence identity to other published Heterosporis sp. on the basis of partial rRNA gene sequence analysis. Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp. (formerly Heterosporis sp.) was identified in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), northern pike (Esox lucius) and walleye (Sander vitreus) from inland lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Heterovesicula cowani (= Vairimorpha sp.) (1),"Pathogenicity and transmission potential of Nosema locustae and Vairimorpha n. sp. (Protozoa: Microsporida) in Mormon crickets (Anabrus simplex; Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Nosema locustae did not produce detectable infections in Mormon crickets in any stage of development. While nymphal development was retarded among insects inoculated as first to third instars with high spore concentrations (106/mg bran), no reductions in survival or oviposition were obtained. A new species of microsporidian (Vairimorpha n. sp.) was isolated from Mormon crickets near Dinosaur National Monument. In laboratory cage tests, this pathogen produced significant mortality among first to third instar Mormon crickets treated with a bran bait containing 106 spores/mg. Lower concentrations (104/mg and 102/mg) did not significantly affect survival, but retarded nymphal development and yielded heavy infections. Crickets inoculated as seventh instars to adults did not exhibit significant changes in survival, infection, or oviposition relative to controls. Before N. locustae can contribute to Mormon cricket management, a ""cricket strain"" of this pathogen must be isolated and tested. However, Vairimorpha n. sp. appears to be a promising biocontrol agent for both short-term host density reductions and longer-term reductions in host development coupled with enhanced transmission potential.",Vairimorpha n. sp.,Anabrus simplex,adipose tissue; Malpighian tubules; fat body,NA,adipose tissue; Malpighian tubules; fat body,NA,NA,NA

Hyperspora aquatica,"Hyperspora aquatica n.gn., n.sp. (Microsporidia), hyperparasitic in Marteilia cochillia (Paramyxida), is closely related to crustacean-infecting microspordian taxa. SUMMARY The Paramyxida, closely related to haplosporidians, paradinids, and mikrocytids, is an obscure order of parasitic protists within the class Ascetosporea. All characterized ascetosporeans are parasites of invertebrate hosts, including molluscs, crustaceans and polychaetes. Representatives of the genus Marteilia are the best studied paramyxids, largely due to their impact on cultured oyster stocks, and their listing in international legislative frameworks. Although several examples of microsporidian hyperparasitism of paramyxids have been reported, phylogenetic data for these taxa are lacking. Recently, a microsporidian parasite was described infecting the paramyxid Marteilia cochillia, a serious pathogen of European cockles. In the current study, we investigated the phylogeny of the microsporidian hyperparasite infecting M. cochillia in cockles and, a further hyperparasite, Unikaryon legeri infecting the digenean Meiogymnophallus minutus, also in cockles. We show that rather than representing basally branching taxa in the increasingly replete Cryptomycota/Rozellomycota outgroup (containing taxa such as Mitosporidium and Paramicrosoridium), these hyperparasites instead group with other known microsporidian parasites infecting aquatic crustaceans. In doing so, we erect a new genus and species (Hyperspora aquatica n. gn., n.sp.) to contain the hyperparasite of M. cochillia and clarify the phylogenetic position of U. legeri. We propose that in both cases, hyperparasitism may provide a strategy for the vectoring of microsporidians between hosts of different trophic status (e.g. molluscs to crustaceans) within aquatic systems. In particular, we propose that the paramyxid hyperparasite H. aquatica may eventually be detected as a parasite of marine crustaceans. The potential route of transmission of the microsporidian between the paramyxid (in its host cockle) to crustaceans, and, the ‘hitch-hiking’ strategy employed by H. aquatica is discussed.",Hyperspora aquatica,Marteilia cochillia,Primary cells,NA,Primary cells,NA,NA,NA
Ichthyosporidium weissii,"Ichthyosporidium weissii n. sp. (Microsporidia) Infecting the Arrow Goby ( Clevelandia ios). Abstract Gonadal infections by a novel microsporidium were discovered in 34% (13/38) of arrow gobies, Clevelandia ios, sampled over a 3‐yr period from Morro Bay Marina in Morro Bay, California. Gonadal tumors had been reported in arrow gobies from this geographic area. The infected gonads, found primarily in females, typically appeared grossly as large, white‐gray firm and lobulated masses. Histological examination revealed large, multilobate xenomas within the ovaries and no evidence of neoplasia. Typical of the genus Ichthyosporidium, the large xenomas were filled with developmental stages and pleomorphic spores. Wet mount preparations showed two general spore types: microspores with mean length of 6.2 (7.0–4.9, SD = 0.6, N = 20) μm and mean width of 4.3 (5.3–2.9, SD = 0.8) μm; and less numerous macrospores with mean length of 8.5 (10.1–7.1, SD = 1.0, N = 10) μm and mean width of 5.5 (6.2–4.8, SD = 0.5) μm. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated stages consistent with the genus and 35–50 turns of the polar filament. Small subunit rDNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the parasite from arrow gobies was most closely related to, but distinct from Ichthyosporidium sp. based on sequences available in GenBank. We conclude that this microsporidium represents a new species of Ichthyosporidium, the first species of this genus described from a member of the family Gobiidae and from the Pacific Ocean.",Ichthyosporidium weissii,Clevelandia ios,Connective tissue in Gonad,NA,Connective tissue in Gonad,NA,gonads,NA
Intrapredatorus barri,"Development of a new microsporidian parasite, Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) from the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann (Diptera: Culicidae). A microsporidium infecting the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann, collected from Liu-Chiu Islet of Taiwan, was shown to be heterosporous. Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts. Although it was similar to species of Amblyospora in host/parasite relations, we would rather assign this parasite to a newly established genus, i.e. Intrapredatorus and the name Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. was given for this microsporidium. The characteristics of the new genus was discussed in this article. However, its transmission routes remained uncertain thus far.",Intrapredatorus barri,Culex fuscanus,fat body,NA,fat body,NA,NA,NA
Janacekia adipophila,"The Light and Electron Microscopic Cytology of Janacekia adipophila N. Sp. (Microspora, Tuzetiidae), a Microsporidian Parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa (Diptera, Ptychopteridae). The microsporidium Janacekia adipophila n. sp., a parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa larvae in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are formed by rosette‐like division. Sporonts develop into sporogonial plasmodia with isolated nuclei. These plasmodia give rise to 8–16 sporoblasts by rosette‐like budding. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Sporoblasts and spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. Granular inclusions of the vesicles, visible using light microscopy, discriminate sporogonial stages from stages of the merogony. The monokaryotic, fresh spores are oval with blunt ends, measuring 4.2‐6.3 × 9.1‐11.2 μm. Macrospores are formed in small numbers. The spore wall has three subdivisions and the exospore is electron‐dense. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, wider sac‐like compartments posteriorly. The isofilar polar filament, 191–264 nm wide, has 12‐13 coils, which are arranged in one layer in the posterior half of the spore. The electron‐dense inclusions of the sporophorous vesicle are modified during sporogony, and vesicles with mature spores are traversed by 21–27 nm wide tubules, which connect the exospore with the envelope of the vesicle. The walls of the tubules, the envelope of the vesicles, and the surface layer of the exospore are all identical double‐layered structures.

Johenrea locustae (1),"Johenrea locustae n.g., n.sp. (Microspora: Glugeidae): A Pathogen of Migratory Locusts (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Oedipodinae) from Madagascar. A new microsporidium was isolated from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria capito, collected in Madagascar. This new species was found to be haplokaryotic throughout development, produced polysporophorous vesicles of parasite origin, and there was conspicuous xenoma formation. The xenoma was a complex structure composed primarily of fat body cells. The wall of the xenoma was bound by a basement membrane beneath which was a region of collagen-like fibers. Multiplication of the parasite occurred by way of both a schizogonic phase and by a sporulation phase. Schizonts divided either directly or with the intervention of paucinucleate plasmodia into additional schizonts. At some point, plasmodia developed (with an increase in size and number of nuclei) into sporogonial plasmodia with typically 16 nuclei. Sporogonial plasmodia elaborated an interfacial envelope within which they underwent sporogony. Sporophorous vesicles normally contained 16 spores but also 8 and rarely 32 spores were formed. Spores were elongate ovoid (sometimes slightly curved) and measured 8.3 by 3.8 μm (fresh) and 6.9 by 4.2 μm (fixed).

Abstract During a survey for grasshopper pathogens in Argentina in 2005–2006, individual Covasacris pallidinota from halophylous grasslands in Laprida, Buenos Aires province were found to be infected with a microsporidium. Infection was restricted to the salivary gland epithelial cells. The microsporidium produced ovocylindrical spores averaging 2.6±0.28×1.4±0.12μm (range 2.2–3.4×1.1–1.7μm), which resembled in size and shape the spores of Liebermannia patagonica and L. dichroplusae, two recently described species that also parasitize Argentine grasshoppers. The life cycle of the microsporidium included the formation of polynucleate, diplokaryotic, moniliform, merogonial plasmodia wrapped in flattened cisterns of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Plasmodia divided to produce diplokaryotic cells. The latter underwent elongation, dissociation of diplokarya counterparts, vacuolization, dismantling of the host ER envelope, and deposition of electron-dense material outside the plasma membrane. The resultant binucleate sporogonial plasmodia divided into two uninucleate sporoblasts, which eventually transformed into spores. Uninucleate spores contained a lamellar polaroplast, embraced by an elongated polar sac, anchoring disc, 3–5 polar filament coils, and a cluster of anastomizing tubules (sporoblast trans-Golgi, posterosome) at the posterior end. Sequence similarity of the SSU rDNA of the newly discovered microsporidium (Genbank accession no. Download EU709818) to L. patagonica and L. dichroplusae was 99% and 97%, respectively, suggesting that the three species belong to one genus. All three species fell into one clade in SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic trees produced by neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses with 100% statistical support. We assign the name Liebermannia covasacrae to this microsporidium. It can be easily differentiated from both congeners by host species, tissue tropism, type of sporogony, and several features of morphology. Comparison of the three Liebermannia spp. demonstrates that the nuclear phase (dikaryotic versus monokaryotic spores) and type of sporogony (polysporous versus disporous) may vary in closely related species.",Liebermannia covasacrae,Covasacris pallidinota,epithelium; salivary gland,NA,epithelium,NA,NA,NA
Liebermannia patagonica,"Development, ultrastructure, natural occurrence, and molecular characterization of Liebermannia patagonica n. g., n. sp., a microsporidian parasite of the grasshopper Tristira magellanica (Orthoptera: Tristiridae). A new microsporidium, Liebermannia patagonica n. gen., n. sp., is described from midgut and gastric caecum epithelial cells of Tristira magellanica, an apterous grasshopper species of southern Patagonia, Argentina. L. patagonica is diplokaryotic, apansporoblastic, homosporous, and polysporoblastic. Transitional (from merogony to sporogony) stages and sporonts of L. patagonica were surrounded by host rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ovocylindrical spores measured 2.9+/-0.09x1.2+/-0.04μm (fresh, n=50), and they had an isofilar polar filament of only three coils and a cluster of tubules instead of a classical posterior vacuole. Prevalence was high (up to 80.6%) at the type locality for the four years sampled. Maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and maximum parsimony analyses of the small subunit rDNA all placed L. patagonica (Accession No. DQ 239917) in one clade with Orthosomella operophterae.",Liebermannia patagonica,Tristira magellanica,epithelium,NA,epithelium,NA,Midgut; gastric caecum,NA
Loma boopsi,"On the Cytology and Development of Loma boopsi n. sp. (Microspora, Glugeidae), Parasite of Boops boops (Pisces, Teleostei, Sparidae) from the Coasts of Senegal. Loma boopsi n. sp. was found in the liver, intestine and pyloric caeca of Boops boops inhabiting the coasts of Senegal. Its ultrastructural characteristics were elucidated. All developmental stages had isolated nuclei and occupied the xenoma without any particular stratification. The merogonial stages were in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm. The merogonial plasmodium divided by plasmotomy. Sporogony occurred in sporophorous vesicles and the sporogonial plasmodium divided by plasmotomy. Two morphological types of spores were produced in the same sporophorous vesicle: ovoid spores measuring 3.70 × 2.40 µm and elongate, slightly incurvated spores which were 4.80 × 2.40 µm. They had a thick envelope (about 70 nm), a polaroplast with an anterior lamellar part and a posterior vesicular part, an isofilar polar filament displaying 12–14 (ovoid spores) or 16–18 (elongate spores) spiral turns in a single row of coils and a large posterior vacuole",Loma boopsi,Boops boops,liver; intestinal epithelium; pyloric caeca,NA,intestinal epithelium,NA,intestine,NA

A new microsporidian, Loma camerounensis, was found in the Cichlidae Oreochromis niloticus from the Melen fish-rearing station in Yaoundé, Cameroon. Xenomas were located in the gut from the oesophagus to the intestine, but preferentially in the duodenum. Dimensions of the fresh spores were 3.96×2.16 μm. The ultrastructural study indicated the following characteristics: parasite stages arranged in a random, unstratified manner in the xenoma; merogony by multiple fission; sporogonic stages isolated within a sporophorous vesicle containing several sporoblasts and polysporoblastic sporogony. Ultimately the spores appeared to be isolated in a single vesicle, but this was a secondary phenomenon induced by the intervention of tubules that resolved in partitions of the initial sporophorous vesicle.",Loma camerounensis,Oreochromis niloticus,oesophagus; intestine; sub-epithelial gut connective tissue,NA,sub-epithelial gut connective tissue,NA,duodenum,NA

ABSTRACT. Five new species of Loma were described from five Pacific fishes using light-microscopic and ultrastructural features along with phylogenetic analysis of the gene sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and elongation factor 1-alpha. Morphological data revealed both qualitative and quantitative differences in developmental stages and timing, vesicles, xenoma features, and spore sizes with statistical support that differentiated Loma pacificodae n. sp. in Pacific cod, Loma wallae n. sp. in walleye pollock, Loma kenti n. sp. in Pacific tomcod, Loma lingcodae n. sp. in lingcod, and Loma richardi n. sp. in sablefish from each other and other species in the genus. Phylogenetic analyses combined with monophyly tests supported species designations, but with low resolution in two cases perhaps due to rRNA paralogs or recent speciation. Loma branchialis in haddock was shown to be separate from Loma morhua in Atlantic cod, thereby making L. morhua, and not L. branchialis, the type species.

Loma myrophis,"Fine structure of a new species, Loma myrophis (Phylum Microsporidia), parasite of the Amazonian fish Myrophis platyrhynchus (Teleostei, Ophichthidae). A new species of a microsporidian, Loma myrophis n. sp., was found in the sub-epithelial gut tissue of the Amazonian teleost fish, Myrophis platyrhynchus (fam. Ophichthidae), forming small whitish xenomas. Each xenoma consisted externally of a thick wall formed by one layer of fibrous material surrounded by aggregate and concentric fibroblasts. Inside, there was a hypertrophic host cell with a hypertrophic branched nucleus surrounded by a hypertrophic cytoplasm containing intermingled life cycle stages, mainly mature spores. Among these cells several extruded polar filaments were observed. Sporonts were surrounded by numerous blisters with dense contents, which appeared to discharge their contents into the parasitophorous vacuole around the parasite. All spores were ellipsoidal and uninucleate, and measured about 3.45 x 1.71 m (n = 50). The polar filament was isofilar and consisted of a single coil with 13-14 turns, surrounding the posterior vacuole that occupied about half of the total volume of the spore. The xenoma, formation of the parasitophorous vacuole and the morphology of the spores were basically like those of the genus Loma.

Loma sp.,"Loma sp. in salmonids from the eastern united states: Associated lesions in rainbow trout. A microsporidian of the genus Loma was noted in the gills of rainbow trout Onco-rhynchus mykiss from a state hatchery (Buford Trout Hatchery) in Georgia. Mortalities of varying severity occur at this hatchery every fall, and the microsporidian was noted during an experiment from August 1991 to January 1992 to determine the effects of water source on disease. Infections first appeared to be systemic in the October sample; xenomas were observed in heart, spleen, and peripheral vessel walls. The presence of unidentified intracellular material preceded the appearance of xenomas in all tissues, but whether this material was associated with inflammation or represented immature stages of the parasite has yet to be determined. These structures were also noted in the intestine and liver, although xenomas were not noted in these organs. Mature xenomas did not elicit an inflammatory response but appeared to be short-lived. When the xenoma wall ruptured and released spores, an inflammatory response was again observed. The prevalence and severity of the infection were determined in fish maintained in troughs with well water, Chattahoochee River water, or hatchery (treated river) water. The infection tended to be more prevalent and more severe in fish maintained in the hatchery or river water than in those maintained in the well water. Stress induced by poor water quality may increase mortality from this parasite.

Lotmaria passim,"Characterization of Two Species of Trypanosomatidae from the Honey Bee Apis mellifera: Crithidia mellificae Langridge and McGhee, and Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp.. Trypanosomatids are increasingly recognized as prevalent in European honey bees (Apis mellifera) and by default are attributed to one recognized species, Crithidia mellificae Langridge and McGhee, 1967. We provide reference genetic and ultrastructural data for type isolates of C. mellificae (ATCC 30254 and 30862) in comparison with two recent isolates from A. mellifera (BRL and SF). Phylogenetics unambiguously identify strains BRL/SF as a novel taxonomic unit distinct from C. mellificae strains 30254/30862 and assign all four strains as lineages of a novel clade within the subfamily Leishmaniinae. In vivo analyses show strains BRL/SF preferably colonize the hindgut, lining the lumen as adherent spheroids in a manner identical to previous descriptions from C. mellificae. Microscopy images show motile forms of C. mellificae are distinct from strains BRL/SF. We propose the binomial Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp. for this previously undescribed taxon. Analyses of new and previously accessioned genetic data show C. mellificae is still extant in bee populations, however, L. passim n. gen., n. sp. is currently the predominant trypanosomatid in A. mellifera globally.

Merocinta davidii,"Ultrastructure and life cycle of Merocinta davidii gen et sp. nov, a dimorphic microsporidian parasite of Mansonia africana (Diptera: Culicidae) from Tanzania. Mansonia africana larvae were sampled at three sites in NE Tanzania, between June and September 1987. At each site between 2.5 and 5.7% were infected with a multisporous microsporidian parasite. The ovoid spores measured 2.5 × 1.5 •m. Meronts were diplokaryotic with electron-dense, thickened unit membranes. Repeated division of the diplokarya gave rise to multinucleate plasmodia, the plasma membrane of which was entirely surrounded by two other membranes interpreted as host endoplasmic reticulum. Both membranes were studded with ribosomes. Meronts became ribbon-like before division, the endoplasmic reticulum dividing with the parasite. At the onset of sporogony the two nuclei of the diplokaryon separated and the electron-dense coat was sloughed off. Nuclear division and cytoplasmic division gave rise to uninucleate sporoblasts and spores. Adult M. africana collected at one of the three sites were infected with two diplokaryotic microsporidia, designated Type A and Type B, which differed only in the size of the spores. Spores of Type A measured 3.4 ×1.8 •m and those of Type B measured 6.6 × 2.9 •m; both types were binucleate. Type A infected 10.8 and Type B 5.8% of the adults collected. Mixed infections were not observed. In transovarial transmission trials, larvae were not successfully reared from adults infected with Type B. However, 11.3% of progeny from females infected with Type A exhibited multisporous microsporidian infections indistinguishable from those found in larvae collected at that site, showing that the multisporous parasite in larvae and the Type A infection of adults represent different stages in the life cycle of a single species.

Microsporidium aurata,"Morphological and phylogenetic description of a new xenoma-inducing microsporidian, Microsporidium aurata nov. sp., parasite of the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata from the Red Sea. A new species of Microsporidia found in the marine teleost Sparus aurata collected from Hurghada coasts along the Red Sea, Egypt was described based on light and ultrastructural studies. Twenty three (30.6 %) out of 75 of the examined fish were parasitized with a microsporidian parasite. Numerous macroscopic whitish cysts embedded in the peritoneal cavity were observed to infect many organs of the body including muscles, connective tissues, and the intestinal epithelium. The infection was developed as tumor-like masses of often up to 5 mm in diameter inducing an enormous hypertrophy to the infected organs. Fresh spores appeared mostly ovoid to pyriform in shape reaching a size of 1.7 ± 0.5 (1.5–2.5) μm × 1.3 ± 0.4 (1–2) μm; they possessed a large vacuole at the posterior end. These spores were located within a sporophorous vesicle which was bound by a thick amorphous wall. The ultrastructural features support the placement of the present species within the genus Microsporidium. The developmental stages were enclosed within a xenoma structure that was bounded by a double-layered cyst wall. The life cycle of the microsporidian pathogen described herein included four stages: proliferation (merogony), sporogony, sporoblast, spores, and liberation. Mature spores appeared electron dense, uninucleate, and were ellipsoidal in shape. At the anterior end of the spore, the anchoring disk was found in a central position. There was a definite number (5–11) of turns of the polar tube. A 538-bp region of the SSU rDNA gene of the studied species was sequenced (GenBank accession number: KF0220444). Multiple sequence alignment calculated a high degree of similarity (>92 %) with six microsporidian species. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry AF151529 for Microsporidium prosopium isolated from Hyperoplus lanceolatus differing in 67 nucleotide positions in its SSU rDNA with the highest percentage of identity (97.2 %) and the lowest divergence value (0.20). Variations in the morphology of the spores and developmental stages between the two species revealed that the two species are different.

Microsporidium phytoseiuli,"Ultrastructure and Pathology of Microsporidium phytoseiulin. sp. Infecting the Predatory Mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Ultrastructure and pathology of Microsporidium phytoseiuli n. sp. infecting the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot is described using light and transmission electron microscopy. Infected mites showed no gross, external symptoms. All observed stages of the parasite had unpaired nuclei. Schizonts were commonly observed within nuclei of digestive cells of the ventriculus and within the cytoplasm of cells lining the cecal wall and in muscle tissue underlying it. Sporoblasts and spores occurred in the nuclei and cytoplasm of digestive cells within the ventriculus, in cortical regions of the sub- and supraesophageal ganglia, within the cecal wall and muscle tissue, and in parenchyma cells underlying the cuticle. Mature spores were also observed in developing eggs within gravid females. These were broad-to elongate-ovoid, measured 4.33 ± 0.35 × 1.27 ± 0.15 μm (electron micrographs), 5.37 ± 0.46 × 2.22 ± 0.17 μm (fixed and stained), and 5.88 ± 0.34 × 2.22 ± 0.19 μm (fresh) and had an isolfilar polar filament coiled 12 to 15 times within the posterior two-thirds. Within cells, individual spores appeared to be in direct contact with host cytoplasm, while groups of spores were infrequently observed within interfacial envelopes. Groups of 4, 8, to more than 16 spores were observed by light microscopy, while 8 was the maximum observed by electron microscopy.

Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae,"New microsporidia parasitizing bark lice (Insecta: Psocoptera). Abstract Two species of bark lice, Xanthocaecilius sommermanae Mockford and Polypsocus corruptus Hagen, collected in a canopy Malaise trap placed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park as part of a survey of the park’s fauna, were found to be infected with microsporidia. Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data. The finding that samples fixed and stored for months in propylene glycol (“antifreeze”) are good enough for DNA sequence analysis and can be used for morphological analyses (if no better fixation alternatives are available), is promising for future surveys for microsporidia.",Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae,Xanthocaecilius sommermanae; Polypsocus corruptus,Muscles,NA,Muscles,NA,NA,NA
Mrazekia macrocyclopis,"Ultrastructure and molecular phylogeny of Mrazekia macrocyclopis sp. n. (Microsporidia, Mrazekiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Macrocyclops albidus (Jur.) (Crustacea, Copepoda). The ultrastructure and molecular phylogeny of a new microsporidium Mrazekia macrocyclopis sp.n., a parasite of the copepod Macrocyclops albidus (Jur.) in North-West of Russia are described. All stages of its life cycle are diplokaryotic. Fresh spores are rod-shaped and 7.3-10.5 × 1.6-2.3 μm in size. Spore ultrastructure is typical of Mrazekia. The polar tube consists of the anterior clavate manubrium followed by a thin filament arranged in 3.5-4.5 nearly vertical coils. Spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. SSU rDNA sequence analysis showed attribution of the new species to a cluster of microsporidia infecting insects (Cystosporogenes, Endoreticulatus), microsrustaceans (Glugoides), vertebrates (Vittaforma) and ciliates (Euplotespora) nested within the clade IV sensu Vossbrinck, Debrunner-Vossbrinck (2005). Mrazekia macrocyclopis is not therefore closely related to Bacillidium vesiculoformis, another microsporidium with rod-shaped spores, and the polyphyletic nature of the family of Mrazekiidae is obvious.",Mrazekia macrocyclopis,Macrocyclops albidus,Adipose,NA,Adipose,NA,NA,NA
Mutated Thelohaniidae sp.,Unusual polar filament structure in two Microsporidia from water reservoirs with radionuclide and organic pollution. Two species of microsporidia with an unusual polar filament structure were found in Cricotopus silvestris and Microtendipes pedellus larvae which were collected near the zone of influence of the Chernobyl atomic power station (Ukraine) and from a high polluted pond in the Mazurian region of Poland. The first microsporidium has separate unikaryotic spores and was assigned to the family Unikaryonidae Sprague. The diameter of the middle coil of the triple-coiled polar filament of this microsporidium was larger than its two other coils. The observed polar filament was thus neither of isofilar nor of the classical anisofilar type. The second polysporoblastic microsporidium has unikaryotic spores and an uncoiled polar filament and was placed in the family Thelohaniidae Hazard and Oldacre. The rare single macrospores of this microsporidium have a double set of the polar filament complex.

Myospora metanephrops,"Myospora metanephrops (n. g., n. sp.) from marine lobsters and a proposal for erection of a new order and family (Crustaceacida; Myosporidae) in the Class Marinosporidia (Phylum Microsporidia). Abstract In this study we describe, the first microsporidian parasite from nephropid lobsters. Metanephrops challengeri were captured from an important marine fishery situated off the south coast of New Zealand. Infected lobsters displayed an unusual external appearance and were lethargic. Histology was used to demonstrate replacement of skeletal and other muscles by merogonic and sporogonic stages of the parasite, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of diplokaryotic meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts and spore stages, all in direct contact with the host sarcoplasm. Analysis of the ssrDNA gene sequence from the lobster microsporidian suggested a close affinity with Thelohania butleri, a morphologically dissimilar microsporidian from marine shrimps. Whilst morphological features of the lobster parasite are consistent with members of the family Nosematidae, molecular data place the parasite closer to members of the family Thelohanidae. Due to the contradiction between morphological and molecular taxonomic data, we propose the erection of a new genus in which the lobster parasite is the type species (Myospora metanephrops). Furthermore, we recommend the erection of a new family (Myosporidae) and a new order (Crustaceacida) to contain this genus. The taxonomic framework presented could be further applied to the re-classification of existing members of the Phylum Microsporidia.",Myospora metanephrops,Metanephrops challengeri,Sarcoplasm of muscle cells,NA,Sarcoplasm of muscle cells,NA,muscles,NA

A new microsporidian genus and species, Myrmecomorba nylanderiae, is described from North American populations of the tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva. This new species was found to be heterosporous producing several types of binucleate spores in both larval and adult stages and an abortive octosporoblastic sporogony in adult ants. While microsporidia are widespread arthropod parasites, this description represents only the fifth species described from an ant host. Molecular analysis indicated that this new taxon is phylogenetically closely allied to the microsporidian family Caudosporidae, a group known to parasitize aquatic black fly larvae.

Nadelspora canceri,"Nadelspora canceri N. G., N. Sp., an Unusual Microsporidian Parasite of the Dungeness Crab, Cancer Magister. The microsporidium Nadelspora canceri n. g., n. sp., is described from the striated musculature of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) in Oregon, USA. The needle‐shaped spores were rounded anteriorly, tapered to a posterior point and measured 7.1–11.8 × 0.2–0.3 μm in fixed preparations. The extremely narrow spore diameter prevented observation of morphological details at the light microscopic level and ultrastructural details of mature spores were difficult to resolve. Meronts were not observed and the monokaryotic merozoites and sporonts were not contained within either parasitophorous or sporophorous vesicles. Sporonts were disporoblastic and gave rise to monokaryotic sporoblasts that became narrow and elongate as they developed into immature spores with a developing polar filament. The nucleus was not clearly resolved in mature spores and may have been surrounded by the lamellar polaroplast. The polar filament was of nearly uniform diameter throughout most of its length and ended abruptly about three‐fourths of the distance from the anterior end of the spore. Unusual spherical non‐membrane bound granules surrounded the polar filament in a spiral arrangement. The new microsporidium resembles members of the family Mrazekiidiae, but differs in lacking a diplokaryon at any stage. It is probably most closely related to Baculea daphniae from which it differs primarily by spore shape and size. The familial relationships of the genus Baculea have not been determined and it is proposed to include it with Nadelspora in the new family Nadelsporidae.",Nadelspora canceri,Cancer magister,striated muscles,NA,striated muscles,NA,striated musculature,NA

The fusiform sporophorous vesicles, the pyriform spores, the unique plurilayered exospore, and the characteristic crystalline inclusions of the episporontal space are characteristics shared by Chapmanium dispersus (R. Larsson, 1984, Protistologica, 20, 547-563). The polar filament and the polaroplast differ in some ways.

Napamichum cellatum,"Napamichum cellatum N. Sp. (Microspora, Thelohaniidae), a New Parasite of Midge Larvae of the Genus Endochironomus (Diptera, Chironomidae) in Sweden. The new microsporidium, Napamichum cellatum, a parasite of the adipose tissue of midge larva of the genus Endochironomus in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Plurinucleate Plasmodia with nuclei arranged as diplokarya divide, probably by plasmotomy, producing a small number of diplokaryotic merozoites. The number of merogonial cycles is unknown. Each diplokaryotic sporont yields eight monokaryotic sporoblasts in a thin‐walled, more or less fusiform sporophorous vesicle. A small number of multisporoblastic sporophorous vesicles were observed, in which a part of the sporoblasts were anomalous. The sporogony probably begins with a meiotic division. The mature spores are slightly pyriform. Fixed and stained spores measure 2.1‐2.4 × 3.7‐4.5 μm. The five‐layered spore wall is of the Napamichum type. The polar filament is anisofilar with seven to eight coils (142‐156 and 120 nm wide). The angle of tilt is 55‐65°. The polaroplast has an anterior lamellar and a posterior tubular part. The granular, tubular and crystal‐like inclusions of the episporontal space disappear more or less completely when the spores mature. The crystal‐like inclusions are prominent in haematoxylin staining, but not visible with the Giemsa technique.

Nematocida displodere,"Discovery of a Natural Microsporidian Pathogen with a Broad Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans. Microbial pathogens often establish infection within particular niches of their host for replication. Determining how infection occurs preferentially in specific host tissues is a key aspect of understanding host-microbe interactions. Here, we describe the discovery of a natural microsporidian parasite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host. Altogether, this system provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.",Nematocida displodere,Caenorhabditis elegans,epidermis; muscle; neurons; intestine; coelomocytes; and seam cells,NA,coelomocytes; and seam cells,NA,NA,NA

Nosema chrysoperlae,"Ultrastructure and molecular characterization of the microsporidium, Nosema chrysoperlae sp. nov., from the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) used for biological pest control. Lacewing larvae are generalist predators that are commercially available for aphid control on a variety of crops in both Europe and North America. Although lacewings are known for their symbiotic association with yeasts and bacteria, there are few reports of microsporidia in these natural enemies. An undescribed microsporidium was found in Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) during the routine examination of specimens that were obtained from a commercial insectary for biological pest control. The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen by means of ultrastructure, molecular characterization and tissue pathology. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony and sporogony were not observed. Mature spores measured 3.49±0.10×1.52±0.05μm and had an isofilar polar filament with 8–10 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row, although double rows were also observed. Spores contained a lamellar polaroplast and a relatively small and inconspicuous polar vacuole was observed in the posterior region of about half of the spores that were examined. Tubular structures, similar in appearance to those in Nosema granulosis were observed in both sporonts and in spores. A cluster of small tubules was also observed in the posterior region of some spores. Microsporidian spores were observed in cells of the proventriculus, diverticulum and in epithelial cells of the posterior midgut. The Malpighian tubules, ileum, and rectum were heavily infected. Spores were also observed in the fat body, peripheral region of the ganglia, within and between the flight muscles, and beneath the cuticle. Although the tissues adjacent to the ovaries were heavily infected, microsporidian spores were not observed within the developing eggs. Pathogen transmission was not studied directly because it was difficult to maintain microsporidia-infected C. carnea in the laboratory. The presence of microsporidian spores in the alimentary canal suggests that the pathogen is transmitted per os and horizontal transmission may occur when infected larvae or adults are cannibalized by uninfected larvae. Molecular analysis of the microsporidian genome showed that the pathogen described in this study was 99% similar to Nosema bombycis, N. furnacalis, N. granulosis and N. spodopterae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in C. carnea be given the name Nosema chrysoperlae sp.

Nosema chrysorrhoeae,"Nosema chrysorrhoeae n. sp. (Microsporidia), isolated from browntail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea L.) (Lepidoptera, Lymantriidae) in Bulgaria: Characterization and phylogenetic relationships. A new microsporidian parasite Nosema chrysorrhoeae n. sp., isolated in Bulgaria from the browntail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea L.), is described. Its life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles that are similar to the general developmental cycles of the Nosema-like microsporidia and are indistinguishable from those of two Nosema spp. from Lymantria dispar. The primary cycle takes place in the midgut tissues and produces binucleate primary spores. The secondary developmental cycle takes place exclusively in the silk glands and produces binucleate environmental spores. N. chrysorrhoeae is specific to the browntail moth. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ssu rRNA gene sequence places N. chrysorrhoeae in the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade, with the microsporidia from lymantriid and hymenopteran hosts.

Nosema furnacalis,"Identification and Isolation of Dimorphic Spores from Nosema furnacalis (Microspora: Nosematidae). Spore morphology of Nosema furnacalis and infectivity for a clone of the Helicoverpa zea cell line were examined by both light and electron microscopy. Dimorphic spores were found in cultured cells infected with N. furnacalis. One type having a few coils of the polar filament (FC spore) germinated spontaneously inside or outside the cell after formation. The other type had many coils of the polar filament (MC spore). The FC spores possessed four coils of the polar filament and MC spores had nine coils on the average. This spore dimorphism was demonstrated to be a characteristic not limited to N. bombycis . With continued passage, the proportion of FC spores in cultured cells sharply increased. Spores isolated after passage 85 to 90 were used to infect cultured cells without prior priming at an alkaline pH.

Nosema granulosis,"Ultrastructural characterisation and molecular taxonomic identification of Nosema granulosis n. sp., a transovarially transmitted feminising (TTF) microsporidium. A novel microsporidian parasite is described, which infects the crustacean host Gammarus duebeni. The parasite was transovarially transmitted and feminised host offspring. The life cycle was monomorphic with three stages. Meronts were found in host embryos, juveniles, and in the gonadal tissue of adults. Sporoblasts and spores were restricted to the gonad. Sporogony was disporoblastic giving rise to paired sporoblasts, which then differentiated to form spores. Spores were not found in regular groupings and there was no interfacial envelope. Spores were approximately 3.78 x 1.22 microns and had a thin exospore wall, a short polar filament, and an unusual granular polaroplast. All life cycle stages were diplokaryotic. A region from the parasite small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on these data places the parasite within the genus Nosema.

Nosema maddoxi,"Nosema maddoxi sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Nosematidae), a Widespread Pathogen of the Green Stink Bug Chinavia hilaris (Say) and the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Halyomorpha halys (Stål). Abstract We describe a unique microsporidian species that infects the green stink bug, Chinavia hilaris; the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys; the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus; and the dusky stink bug, Euschistus tristigmus. All life stages are unikaryotic, but analysis of the consensus small subunit region of the ribosomal gene places this microsporidium in the genus Nosema, which historically has been characterized by diplokaryotic life stages. It is also characterized by having the reversed arrangement of the ribosomal gene (LSU –ITS‐ SSU) found in species within the “true Nosema” clade. This microsporidium is apparently Holarctic in distribution. It is present in H. halys both where it is native in Asia and where it is invasive in North America, as well as in samples of North American native C. hilaris collected prior to the introduction of H. halys from Asia. Prevalence in H. halys from mid‐Atlantic, North America in 2015–2016 ranged from 0.0% to 28.3%, while prevalence in C. hilaris collected in Illinois in 1970–1972 ranged from 14.3% to 58.8%. Oral infectivity and pathogenicity were confirmed in H. halys and C. hilaris. Morphological, ultrastructural, and ecological features of the microsporidium, together with a molecular phylogeny, establish a new species named Nosema maddoxi sp.

The development of Nosema marucae was followed in its host, the legume pod borer Maruca testulalis. The meronts had an irregular cell body and were binucleated, with the large diplokaryon occupying most of the cell. The sporonts contained many rough endoplastic reticula. The sporoblasts had a granular cytoplasm with a large number of ribosomes, and nuclear division and cellular cleavage were prevalent, particularly from 84 to 120 h after inoculation. Sporoblasts and young spores were evident from 108 to 144 h after inoculation. In the mature spores, the exocuticle had a rough and sculptured surface and the endocuticle thinned considerably at the apical end. The anchoring disc was thick at the point of attachment. The polar tube had 12–15 loops, and the polaroplast was multilayered with two distinct regions and occupied almost half of the spore.

Background: Chrysomela (=Melasoma) populi is one of the most serious pests on poplar plantations. In the present study, a microsporidian pathogen, Nosema melasomae infecting Crysomela populi is re-recorded from a new geographical locality and its spore ultrastructure is given for the first time. Methods: Larvae and adults of C. populi were dissected in Ringer’s solution and prepared wet smears were examined under a microscope. Detected fresh and stained spores were measured and photographed using an Olympus BX51 micro- scope with a DP-25 digital camera and a DP2-BSW Soft Imaging System. The ultrastructure of the pathogen was studied with a Philips EM 208 transmission electron microscope using standard preparation techniques as previously described Results:Fresh spores of the microsporidian pathogen are elongate, 4.86 ± 0.71 µm in length and 1.64 ± 0.19 µm in width. The spore wall is considerable thin, measured 60 to 100 nm and consists of a clear endospore (40 to 80 nm) and an electron-dense, uniform exospore (15 to 30 nm). The polar filament is isofilar and has only 6-8 coils. Nuclei in the cell are 400-560 nm in diameter. The polaroplast has a thin lamellated structure. Conclusion:The pathogen from C. populi is N. melasomae Sidor & Jodal, 1986 and its systematic position given by Sidor and Jodal.

A microsporidian parasite, Nosema muscidifuracis n. sp., has been found in Muscidifurax raptor, a parasitoid of muscoid flies. Stages of the parasite developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm and were detected in midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ovaries (including oocytes) and fat body of larvae and adults. Spores were also detected within eggs deposited on the host. Light and electron microscopy revealed a developmental cycle with diplokaryotic stages dividing by binary fission and disporous sporulation sequences producing diplokaryotic spores of three morphological classes, differing significantly only in length of the polar filament. Two of the classes were found in larvae, pupae and adults. One of these, with about five turns in the coiled polar filament, is presumed to be responsible for transmission from cell to cell within the host (autoinfection) and the other, with about 10 turns, responsible for transmission from host to host. A third class, with about 15 turns in the polar filament, was found in eggs of M. raptor. It is, presumably, either involved in initiation and spread of the infection at eclosion or is responsible for horizontal transmission to a new host individual when eggs are cannibalized.",Nosema muscidifuracis,Muscidifurax raptor,midgut epithelium; Malpighian tubules; ovary; oocytes; fat body; egg,NA,ovary,NA,ovaries; oocytes,NA

The microsporidium Nosema neumanni n. sp., a new parasite of the honeybee Apis mellifera is described based on its ultra-structural and molecular characteristics. Structures resembling microsporidian spores were found by microscopic examination of honeybees from Uganda. Molecular confirmation failed when PCR primers specific for Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae were used, but was successful with primers covering the whole family of Nosematidae. We performed transmission electron microscopy and found typical microsporidian spores which were smaller (length: 2.36±0.14μm and width: 1.78±0.06μm; n=6) and had fewer polar filament coils (10–12) when compared to those of known species infecting honeybees. The entire 16S SSU rRNA region was amplified, cloned and sequenced and was found to be unique with the highest resemblance (97% identity) to N. apis.

Nosema partelli,"Development of Nosema partelli, new species (Protozoa: Microsporida: Nosematidae) in the stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The development of a new species of Nosema (N. partelli sp. n.) from the spotted stem borer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), is described. The microsporidia infect eggs, all larval stages and moths of both sexes of the borer. Infection of the eggs implies that transovarial transmission occurs. Spores of constant size are produced, meronts are mainly binucleated but may contain up to eight nuclei. Presporoblastic meronts are single structures, there are no linear or colony formations. Individual diplokaryotic sporoblasts are chromophilic, and slight overstaining produces almost black spherical and oval structures. The diplokaryotic nucleus is characterized by an achromatic line less than 1 mu-m in width which divides it through its centre. This characteristic does not occur in other species of Nosema and is unique to N. partelli. It occurs through all developmental stages from the diplokaryotic sporoblast to the encysting spores. Sporogony is heralded by spindle-shaped diplokaryotic sporoblasts.

Nosema pernyi (1),"Morphological and molecular characterization of Nosema pernyi, a microsporidian parasite in Antheraea pernyi. Nosema pernyi is a lethal pathogen that causes microsporidiosis in the Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi. In this study, we presented its morphological and some molecular characteristics. The mature spores were measured to be 4.36 × 1.49 μm. The spore wall consisted of an electron-dense exospore (EX) and electron-lucent endospore (EN) layer. The polar filament (PF) was isofilar with 10–12 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. Investigation results indicated that N. pernyi can infect the gut wall, silk glands, and other tissues. A full-length SMART cDNA library of N. pernyi was constructed, and then 824 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced. Ninety unigenes, out of 197 assembled unigenes, showed significant homology to known genes of Nosema ceranae, Nosema bombycis, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and other microsporidian species. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the α- and β-tubulin genes and amino acid sequence of actin gene, phylogenetic trees analysis showed that N. pernyi was closely related to Nosema philosamiae and Nosema antheraeae. It was correctly assigned to the Nosema group.",Nosema pernyi,Antheraea pernyi,gut wall; silk glands; blood cells; Malpighian tubes; muscles; ovary; nerves; and epidermis,NA,blood cells; Malpighian tubes; muscles; ovary; nerves; and epidermis,NA,NA,NA

Nosema pieriae,"Nosema pieriae sp. n. (Microsporida, Nosematidae): A New Microsporidian Pathogen of the Cabbage Butterfly Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). A new microsporidian pathogen of the cabbage butterfly, Pieris brassicae is described based on light microscopy, ultrastructural characteristics and comparative small subunit rDNA analysis. The pathogen infects the gut of P. brassicae. All development stages are in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Meronts are spherical or ovoid. Spherical meronts measure 3.68 ± 0.73 × 3.32 ± 1.09 μm and ovoid meronts 4.04 ± 0.74 × 2.63 ± 0.49 μm. Sporonts are spherical to elongate (4.52 ± 0.48 × 2.16 ± 0.27 μm). Sporoblasts are elongated and measure 4.67 ± 0.60 × 2.30 ± 0.30 μm in length. Fresh spores with nuclei arranged in a diplokaryon are oval and measure 5.29 ± 0.55 μm in length and 2.31 ± 0.29 μm in width. Spores stained with Giemsa's stain measure 4.21 ± 0.50 μm in length and 1.91 ± 0.24 μm in width. Spores have an isofilar polar filament with six coils.

Nosema pilicornis,"A microsporidium, Nosema pilicornis sp. n., of the purslane sawfly, Schizocerella pilicornis. A new microsporidian species, Nosema pilicornis, which infects the purslane sawfly, Schizocerella pilicornis, is described. This microsporidium infects most body tissues of the host. N. pilicornis was compared to other microsporidian species infecting Hymenoptera and to a group of similar microsporidia infecting Lepidoptera. N. pilicornis could be distinguished from all other microsporidian species on the basis of host range and ultrastructural characteristics of the spore. Spores were oval, containing 11 to 12 polar filament coils, and the polar filament had an angle of tilt of about 80°. N. pilicornis infected lepidopteran larvae, but only when heavy spore dosages were fed to early larval instars. S. pilicornis is a good but sporadic biological control agent of common purslane, Portulaca oleracea, a pernicious weed of vegetable, ornamental, and orchard crops.

Nosema portugal,"Nosema portugal, N. SP., Isolated from Gypsy Moths (Lymantria dispar L.) Collected in Portugal. A microsporidium Nosema portugal n. sp. was isolated from gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L, collected near Lisbon, Portugal, in 1985. The Life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles, a primary and a secondary cycle. The primary cycle occurs in midgut epithelial cells, where primary spores are produced within 48 h. The primary spores immediately extrude their polar filaments, presumably to infect other cells. In the target tissues (salivary glands and fat body) the secondary development cycle is followed by the formation of environmental spores. Primary spores were also sometimes present in target tissues. Fresh unfixed and unstained primary spores have a large posterior vacuole and measured 4.8 x 2.7 mu m. Ultrastructurally, they have 5-8 polar filament coils, a large posterior vacuole, abundant endoplasmic reticulum, and were binucleate. Mature unfixed and unstained environmental spores were highly refractive and the posterior vacuole and nuclei could not be seen through the spore coat. Fresh environmental spores measured 4.5 x 1.9 mu m. Ultrastructurally, environmental spores were binucleate, with a typical polaroplast, 10-11 isofilar polar filament coils, and a series of 4-6 thin polar filament-like tubules situated at the posterior end of the row of typical polar filament coils. The ssu rRNA sequences strongly suggest that this species is more closely related to the Vairimorpha subgroup within the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade than to the Nosema subgroup",Nosema portugal,Lymantria dispar,midgut epithelium; muscles around midgut; silk gland; fat body,NA,midgut epithelium; muscles around midgut; silk gland,NA,salivary glands,NA

A light and electron microscopic study was conducted of a microsporidium isolated from the grasshopper Pyrgomorpha cognata Krauss, 1877 collected in Santo Antão and Santiago Islands, Cape Verde. The evidence suggests that although there are some differences, such as tissues affected and size of spores, the organism appears conspecific with Nosema pyrgomorphae Toguebaye, Seck & Marchand, 1988, which was described from another species of the genus Pyrgomorpha Audinet‐Serville, 1838 in Senegal.

Nosema rachiplusiae,"Biological and molecular features of Nosema rachiplusiae sp. n., a microsporidium isolated from the neotropical moth Rachiplusia nu (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Light, electron microscopy and DNA analyses were performed to characterize a microsporidium infecting Rachiplusia nu larvae from a laboratory rearing in Argentina. Diplokaryotic spores were oval and measured 3.61 ± 0.29 × 1.61 ± 0.14 μM (fresh). The spore wall was composed of an electron-dense exospore and an electron-lucent endospore, ca. 30 nm and 100–120 nm thick, respectively. The polar filament was arranged in a single rank of 10–12 coils (typically 11). Microsporidian cells were found in the cytoplasm, next to the endoplasmic reticulum (especially the prespore stages) and generally surrounded by electron-lucent spaces. The infection was polyorganotropic; the fat body appeared as the most heavily invaded tissue, followed by tracheal matrix and epidermis. A molecular phylogeny based on the small (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA genes clearly placed the new isolate within the “Nosema bombycis clade”. Considering both SSU and LSU concatenated partial sequences, the microsporidium from R. nu showed 99.5% nucleotide similarity with N. bombycis and 99.8% with its closest relative, a microsporidium isolated from Philosamia cynthia.

Nosema tyriae,"Nosema tyriae n.sp. and Nosema sp., microsporidian parasites of Cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae. Nosema tyriae n.sp. was found in 63% of a population of Cinnabar moth larvae (Tyria jacobaeae). The infection was found in the gut wall, silk glands, and fat body and was probably generalized but appeared to be of low pathogenicity. Merogony and sporogony were by binary fission of diplokaryotic stages. Fresh spores were elongate, slightly pointed at the anterior end, and measured 4.7 x 2.0 microm. Ultrastructural features of special interest were 20-nm tubules connecting the surface of sporonts with host cell cytoplasm and, in the spores, a deeply domed polar sac, polaroplast consisting of closely packed longitudinally arranged membranes and loosely packed horizontally arranged membranes, and 10.5-14 coils of the polar tube in a single rank. The 16S rRNA genes of N. tyriae and Nosema bombycis from silkworms, Bombyx mori, differed by only six nucleotides and N. tyriae spores gave a moderately positive reaction with a monoclonal antibody raised to N. bombycis. N. tyriae was infective to B. mori but was less virulent than N. bombycis. However, no amplification product was obtained by PCR using N. tyriae DNA and primers considered to be specific for N. bombycis. Also, the spores of the two species are of entirely different shapes. A second diplokaryotic microsporidium, Nosema sp., found as a light infection in only one of the larvae had much smaller developmental stages and spores measuring 3.8 x 2.0 microm (fixed). Ultrastructurally it was distinguished by an abundance of dense membranes in cytoplasmic vesicles in both meronts and sporonts. Spores with up to 15 coils of the polar tube in irregular clusters or with about 12 coils in a single rank were observed in the tissues fixed from the one larva infected with this parasite. As this larva had been kept with N. tyriae-infected larvae for a few days before examination, it is possible that the two types of spores resulted from a double infection.",Nosema tyriae,Tyria jacobaeae,gut wall; silk gland; fat body; adipose tissue; systemic infection,NA,adipose tissue; systemic infection,NA,NA,NA
Nosema wistmansi,"The Taxonomy of Three Species of Microsporidia (Protozoa: Microspora) from an Oakwood Population of Winter Moths Operophtera Brumata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). Two species of stored product pests, Ptinus pusillus and P. Brunneus which were collected in watermills, and later reared in laboratory, became infected by two protozoan parasites, a coccidian Adelina tribolii comb. nov. And a microsporidian Nosema ptinidorum n. sp. Both parasites invade the fat body of adults of host-animals. The larvae remained free from infection. The two new pathogens are described and pictured. This is the first report on coccidian and microsporidian parasites found in stored product pests of the Family Ptinidae, Coleoptera.Three species of microsporidia from a population of winter moths, Operophtera brumata (L.), were examined by light microscopy. Pleistophora operophterae (Canning, 1960) is redescribed. The stages with one or two nuclei which were originally termed presporonts are now interpreted as fragments of disrupted vacuolated sporonts or prematuraly separated sporoblasts. The range of spore numbers within sporophorous vesicles is modified to 4 to c.60, rather than 10 to c.100. This species cannot be retained in the genus Pleistophora Gurley, 1893, redefined by Canning & Nicholas (1980), but ultrastructural studies are required before taxonomic reassignment is attempted. Nosema operophterae Canning, 1960 is also redescribed. Merogony consists mainly of binary fission of binucleate and tetranucleate stages but large irregular-shaped multinucleate meronts were also present. Ribbon-shaped sporonts with two, four or eight linearly-spaced nuclei give rise, via binucleate segments, to chains of uninucleate sporoblasts. The species is transferred to a new genus Orthosoma n.g. as Orthosoma operophterae (Canning, 1960) since its isolated nuclei and polysporoblastic sporogony are not characteristic of the genus Nosema Nägeli, 1857. The third species Nosema operophterae Purrini & Skatulla, 1979 is renamed N. wistmansi nom.nov. because the name given by Purrini & Skatulla was preoccupied and is now a synonym of O. operophterae.

Novothelohania ovalae,"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching. Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Novothelohania ovalae,NA,adipose in larvae,NA,adipose in larvae,NA,NA,NA
Nucleospora cyclopteri (1),"Nucleospora cyclopteri n. sp., an intranuclear microsporidian infecting wild lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus L., in Icelandic waters. Background Commercial fisheries of lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus have been carried out in Iceland for centuries. Traditionally the most valuable part is the eggs which are harvested for use as a caviar substitute., Previously reported parasitic infections from lumpfish include an undescribed intranuclear microsporidian associated with abnormal kidneys and mortalities in captive lumpfish in Canada. During Icelandic lumpfish fisheries in spring 2011, extensive enlargements to the kidneys were observed in some fish during processing. The aim of this study was to identify the pathogen responsible for these abnormalities. Methods Lumpfish from the Icelandic coast were examined for the causative agent of kidney enlargement. Fish were dissected and used in histological and molecular studies. Results Lumpfish, with various grades of clinical signs, were observed at 12 of the 43 sites sampled around Iceland. From a total of 77 fish examined, 18 had clear clinical signs, the most prominent of which was an extensive enlargement and pallor of the kidneys. The histopathology of the most severely affected fish consisted of extensive degeneration and necrosis of kidney tubules and vacuolar degeneration of the haematopoietic tissue. Intranuclear microsporidians were detected in all organs examined in fish with prominent clinical signs and most organs of apparently healthy fish using the new PCR and histological examination. One or multiple uniformly oval shaped spores measuring 3.12 ± 0.15 × 1.30 ± 0.12 μm were observed in the nucleus of affected lymphocytes and lymphocyte precursor cells. DNA sequencing provided a ribosomal DNA sequence that was strongly supported in phylogenetic analyses in a clade containing other microsporidian parasites from the Enterocytozoonidae, showing highest similarity to the intranuclear microsporidian Nucleospora salmonis. Conclusions Intranuclear microsporidian infections are common in wild caught lumpfish from around the Icelandic coast. Infections can cause severe clinical signs and extensive histopathological changes, but are also present, at lower levels, in fish that do not show clinical signs. Some common features exist with the intranuclear microsporidian previously reported from captive Canadian lumpfish, but DNA sequence data is required from Canadian fish to confirm conspecificity., Based on phylogenetic analysis and the intranuclear location of the parasite, the name Nucleospora cyclopteri n. sp. is proposed.",Nucleospora cyclopteri,Cyclopterus lumpus,Infected lymphocytes infiltrate haematopoietic tissues; heart; myocardium; gills; skin,kidney and spleen,Infected lymphocytes infiltrate haematopoietic tissues; heart; myocardium; gills; skin,kidney and spleen,kidney,NA

A new intranuclear microsporidium, Nucleospora secunda n.sp., infecting intestinal epithelial cells of Nothobranchius rubripinnis Seegers, 1986, is described. Developmental stages and spores are isolated from one another in the karyoplasm. Merogony proceeds from simple uninucleate meronts to multinucleate meronts. Transformation into sporogonial plasmodia is marked by the appearance of ellipsoidal dark bodies, comparable to polar tube precursors, which later coalesce to form the turns of the polar tube. Primordia of the extrusion apparatus are already established in the plasmodium before it starts to cleave into separate sporoblasts. Ellipsoidal mature spores are of average size 1.6 x 0.8 m and have 4 to 5 turns of the polar tube. The polaroplast consists of an outer region of closely spaced lamellae, enclosing a region of widely spaced lamellae or loose flat cisternae.

Oligosporidium occidentalis,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new microsporidian species from the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari, Phytoseiidae). A new microsporidian species is described from the predatory mite Metaseiulus (formerly Typhlodromus or Galendromus) occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari, Phytoseiidae). The ultrastructure of this new species is presented together with the first molecular characterization for a microsporidium of mites. All stages of this new microsporidium are haplokaryotic and develop in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm. Sporogony is disporoblastic and spores are formed in eggs, immature stages, and adults of M. occidentalis. There are two morphological classes of spores, one with a short polar filament (3–5 coils) that measured m and one with a longer polar filament (8–9 coils) that measured m. Horizontal transmission of this new species occurs by cannibalism of eggs and other stages and perhaps involves the spores with the long polar filament. Spores with the short polar filament may play a role in autoinfection and vertical (transovarial) transmission that is highly efficient in transferring the microsporidium from adults to progeny. Analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA indicated that this species from M. occidentalis is most closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade of microsporidia. A conflict between the morphological and molecular data is discussed.

Ovipleistophora arlo,"Evidence for trophic transfer of Inodosporus octospora and Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp. (Microsporidia) between crustacean and fish hosts. Within aquatic habitats, the hyper-abundant Order Crustacea appear to be the predominant host group for members of the Phylum Microsporidia. The musculature, a common site of infection, provides access to biochemical (carbohydrate-rich) and physiological (mitochondria-rich) conditions conducive to prolific parasite replication and maturation. The significant proportion of body plan devoted to skeletal musculature in Crustacea provides the location for a highly efficient intracellular parasite factory. In this study, we utilize histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic evidence to describe a previously known (Inodosporus octospora) and novel (Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp.) microsporidian parasites infecting the musculature of the common prawn (Palaemon serratus) from the same site, at the same time of year. Despite similar clinical signs of infection, both parasites are otherwise distinct in terms of pathogenesis, morphology and phylogeny. Based upon partial subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) sequence, we show that that I. octospora may be identical to a Kabatana sp. previously described infecting two-spot goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) in Europe, or at least that Inodosporus and Kabatana genera are synonyms. In addition, SSU rDNA sequence for O. arlo places it within a distinct clade containing Ovipleistophora mirandellae and Ovipleistophora ovariae, both infecting the oocytes of freshwater fish in Europe. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for trophic-transfer between crustacean and fish hosts for two different microsporidians within clade 5 of the phylum. Furthermore, it demonstrates that morphologically and phylogenetically distinct microsporidians can infect the same tissues of the same host species to impart clinical signs which mimic infection with the other.",Ovipleistophora arlo,Palaemon serratus,Skeletal musculature of abdomen and thorax,NA,Skeletal musculature of abdomen and thorax,NA,musculature,NA
Ovipleistophora diplostomuri (1),"Phylogeny and morphology of Ovipleistophora diplostomuri n. sp. (Microsporidia) with a unique dual-host tropism for bluegill sunfish and the digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum (Strigeatida). SUMMARY Microsporidia are diverse opportunistic parasites abundant in aquatic organisms with some species hyperparasitic in digenean parasites. In the current study, we describe a unique microsporidian parasite, Ovipleistophora diplostomuri n. sp. that has a tropism for both the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, and its digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum. Though the microsporidium first infects a fish, the subsequent infection causes hypertrophy of the metacercarial wall and degeneration of the P. minimum metacercariae within the fish tissue. Genetic analysis placed this species within Ovipleistophora and ultrastructural characteristics were consistent with the genus, including the presence of dimorphic spores within sporophorous vesicles. Meronts did not have a surface coat of dense material, which has been previously reported for the genus. This is the first Ovipleistophora species described that does not have a tropism for ovary. Genetics demonstrated that O. diplostomuri n. sp. groups closely within fish microsporidia and not other species known to be hyperparasitic in digeneans, suggesting that it evolved from fish-infecting microsporidians and developed a secondary tropism for a common and widespread digenean parasite. The high genetic identity to Ovipleistophora species demonstrates the close relationship of this unique microsporidian with other microsporidia that infect ovary.",Ovipleistophora diplostomuri,Lepomis macrochirus; Posthodiplostomum minimum,Internal organs; most commonly in liver; but also in spleen; kidney; epicardium,NA,Internal organs; most commonly in liver; but also in spleen; kidney; epicardium,NA,NA,NA
Pankovaia semitubulata,"ankovaia semitubulata gen. et sp. n. (Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae) from nymphs of mayflies Cloeon dipterum L. (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) in Western Siberia. Abstract The ultrastructure of a new microsporidian, Pankovaia semitubulata gen. et sp. n. (Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae), from the fat body of Cloeon dipterum (L.) (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) is described. The species is monokaryotic throughout the life cycle, developing in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Sporogonial plasmodium divides into 2–8 sporoblasts. Each sporoblast, then spore, is enclosed in an individual sporophorous vesicle. Fixed and stained spores of the type species P. semitubulata are 3.4×1.9μm in size. The polaroplast is bipartite (lamellar and vesicular). The polar filament is isofilar, possessing 6 coils in one row. The following features distinguish the genus Pankovaia from other monokaryotic genera of Tuzetiidae: (a) exospore is composed of multiple irregularly laid tubules with a lengthwise opening, referred to as “semitubules”; (b) episporontal space of sporophorous vesicle (SPV) is devoid of secretory formations; (c) SPV envelope is represented by a thin fragile membrane.",Pankovaia semitubulata,Cloeon dipterum,adipose,NA,adipose,NA,fat body,NA
Paradoxium irvingi,"Paradoxium irvingi n.gen. n.sp. (Microsporidia) infecting the musculature of European pink shrimp Pandalus montagui. This paper utilises histological, ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic data to describe a novel genus and species (Paradoxium irvingi n.gen., n.sp.) within clade 5 of the phylum Microsporidia. The parasite infects the musculature of the pink shrimp Pandalus montagui captured from United Kingdom waters. The novel microsporidium is morphologically and phylogenetically dissimilar to its nearest phylogenetic branch relative Thelohania butleri infecting the sister shrimp taxon Pandalus jordani. Furthermore, it is morphologically distinct from the type species of the genus Thelohania, Thelohania giardi infecting European brown shrimp Crangon crangon. Since phylogenetic data pertaining to type T. giardi is not currently available, our discovery places some doubt on the likelihood that T. butleri represents the proposed surrogate for the type taxon. Further it demonstrates potential for significant morphological plasticity in this clade of muscle-infecting microsporidians of crustaceans which contains the genera Myospora, Cucumispora, Thelohania, and now Paradoxium. Since it cannot be stated with certainty that T. butleri (or other taxa within the clade) represent true close relatives of T. giardi, clarity on this issue will only occur with re-discovery and genotyping of type T. giardi infecting C. crangon from European waters.",Paradoxium irvingi,Pandalus montagui,skeletal musculature; heart myofibres; longitudinal and circular muscles surrounding the gut,NA,skeletal musculature; heart myofibres; longitudinal and circular muscles surrounding the gut,NA,musculature,NA

Seven microsporidian species infecting caddis fly larvae, corresponding to conventional genera Episeptum, Pyrotheca and Cougourdella were studied using light and electron microscopy. Parts of their small subunit, ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced and compared with sequences of rDNA obtained from syntype slides of Cougourdella polycentropi Weiser 1965 and Pyrotheca sp. from Hydropsyche pellucidula. All studied caddis fly microsporidia form a closely related group. Their developmental stages in trichopteran hosts are restricted to fat body cells and oenocytes and have isolated nuclei. In late merogony, uninucleate meronts and binucleate plasmodia are formed. In sporogony a sporogonial plasmodium with four nuclei gives rise by rosette-like budding to four sporoblasts within a non-persistent sporophorous vesicle. Sporoblasts mature into pyriform to lageniform spores. The shape and size of spores, the number of polar filament coils, the structure of the polaroplast and of the exospore, together with morphometric characters present a set of markers unique for respective species. Four new species are established. The new genus Paraepiseptum is proposed to replace the tetrasporoblastic Pyrotheca and Cougourdella species from caddis flies. The genus Episeptum is redefined.

Parahepatospora carcini,"Parahepatospora carcini n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of invasive Carcinus maenas with intermediate features of sporogony between the Enterocytozoon clade and other microsporidia. Parahepatospora carcini n. gen. n. sp., is a novel microsporidian parasite discovered infecting the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas of a single Carcinus maenas specimen. The crab was sampled from within its invasive range in Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia). Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were used to show the development of the parasite within a simple interfacial membrane, culminating in the formation of unikaryotic spores with 5–6 turns of an isofilar polar filament. Formation of a multinucleate meront (>12 nuclei observed) preceded thickening and invagination of the plasmodial membrane, and in many cases, formation of spore extrusion precursors (polar filaments, anchoring disk) prior to complete separation of pre-sporoblasts from the sporogonial plasmodium. This developmental feature is intermediate between the Enterocytozoonidae (formation of spore extrusion precursors within the sporont plasmodium) and all other Microsporidia (formation of spore extrusion precursors after separation of sporont from the sporont plasmodium). SSU rRNA-based gene phylogenies place P. carcini within microsporidian Clade IV, between the Enterocytozoonidae and the so-called Enterocytospora-clade, which includes Enterocytospora artemiae and Globulispora mitoportans. Both of these groups contain gut-infecting microsporidians of aquatic invertebrates, fish and humans. According to morphological and phylogenetic characters, we propose that P. carcini occupies a basal position to the Enterocytozoonidae.

Paranucleospora theridion,"Paranucleospora theridion n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporidia, Enterocytozoonidae) with a Life Cycle in the Salmon Louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis, Copepoda) and Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). ABSTRACT . Paranucleospora theridion n. gen, n. sp., infecting both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and its copepod parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis is described. The microsporidian exhibits nuclei in diplokaryotic arrangement during all known life-cycle stages in salmon, but only in the merogonal stages and early sporogonal stage in salmon lice. All developmental stages of P. theridion are in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. In salmon, two developmental cycles were observed, producing spores in the cytoplasm of phagocytes or epidermal cells (Cycle-I) and in the nuclei of epidermal cells (Cycle-II), respectively. Cycle-I spores are small and thin walled with a short polar tube, and are believed to be autoinfective. The larger oval intranuclear Cycle-II spores have a thick endospore and a longer polar tube, and are probably responsible for transmission from salmon to L. salmonis. Parasite development in the salmon louse occurs in several different cell types that may be extremely hypertrophied due to P. theridion proliferation. Diplokaryotic merogony precedes monokaryotic sporogony. The rounded spores produced are comparable to the intranuclear spores in the salmon in most aspects, and likely transmit the infection to salmon. Phylogenetic analysis of P. theridion partial rDNA sequences place the parasite in a position between Nucleospora salmonis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based on characteristics of the morphology, unique development involving a vertebrate fish as well as a crustacean ectoparasite host, and the results of the phylogenetic analyses it is suggested that P. theridion should be given status as a new species in a new genus.",Paranucleospora theridion,Salmo salar; Lepeophtheirus salmonis,epithelial cells; leukocytes; endothelial cells; connective; haemocytes,NA,epithelial cells; leukocytes; endothelial cells; connective; haemocytes,NA,phagocytes (Salmo salar); epidermal cells (Salmo salar),NA
Parathelohania aquasalensis,"Nueva especie de Parathelohania (Microsporidia) en larvas de Anopheles aquasalis (Diptera: Culicidae) en Venezuela. The symptoms of Anopheles aquasalis larvae naturally infected by a microsporidium, and the ultrastructure of the infecting spores is described. The larvae were maintained under laboratory conditions in salt concentrations of 10 g/l and 20 g/l of water. Daily recordings of the mortality of the larvae were made and the dates of change of instar were noted. Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages. The mature spores found in the intestines of infected larvae were barrel shaped and measured approximately 2.6 x 2.4 mm. The exospore has a collar shaped prolongation at the posterior end of the spore. The spores are uninuclear with a posterior vacuole. The polar filament is anisofilar with nine rings, five with a diameter of 58 nm each and four with a diameter of 23 nm each. The polarplast is lamellate, and more tightly packed in the apical region. The reduction of the survival of A. aquasalis larvae infected with the microsporidia, and the increase in the development time suggest that this parasite might have a potential as a biological control of this pest. The microsporidium described here has similar characteristics to that of the genus Parathelohania. I suggest that the microsporidium found in A. aquasalis represents a new species and I propose the name Parathelohania aquasalensis. This is the first report of a microsporidium from a dipteran in Venezuela.",Parathelohania aquasalensis,Anopheles aquasalis,intestinal,NA,intestinal,NA,intestines,NA

Percutemincola moriokae,"A new microsporidium Percutemincola moriokae gen. nov., sp. nov. from Oscheius tipulae: A novel model of microsporidia–nematode associations. Here, we describe a new microsporidium Percutemincola moriokae gen. nov., sp. nov., which was discovered in the intestinal and hypodermal cells of a wild strain of the nematode Oscheius tipulae that inhabits in the soil of Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan. The spores of Pe. moriokae had an average size of 1.0 × 3.8 µm and 1.3 × 3.2 µm in the intestine and hypodermis, respectively, and electron microscopy revealed that they exhibited distinguishing features with morphological diversity in the hypodermis. Isolated spores were able to infect a reference strain of O. tipulae (CEW1) through horizontal transmission but not the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon infection, the spores were first observed in the hypodermis and then in the intestine the following day, suggesting a unique infectious route among nematode-infective microsporidia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis grouped this new species with the recently identified nematode-infective parasites Enteropsectra and Pancytospora forming a monophyletic sister clade to Orthosomella in clade IV, which also includes human pathogens such as Enterocytozoon and Vittaforma. We believe that this newly discovered species and its host could have application as a new model in microsporidia–nematode association studies.",Percutemincola moriokae,Oscheius tipulae,Hypodermis; then intestine,NA,then intestine,NA,intestine,NA

A new microsporidia Glugea sardinellensis n. sp. found in the teleost fish Sardinella aurita Valenciennes collected from the Tunisian coasts. The parasite develops in a large xenomas measuring 1–16 mm in diameter and is generally visible with naked eye in the connective tissue around the pyloric caeca of the host. Xenoma were often rounded, but would be occasionally ovoid or irregular shape, generally creamy but rarely opaque, and filled with mature spores. The spores were unikaryotic pyriform measuring 5–5.5 (5.25±0.24) µm in length and 2.5–3 (2.75±0.24) µm in width. The posterior vacuole was large and occupied more than half of the spore. Ultrastructural study indicated that the mature spore has 13–14 coils of polar filament arranged in one layer, and a rough exospore. Intermediate stages were rare and randomly distributed in the xenoma. Merogonial and sporogonial stages were uni or binucleate. The plasma membrane surrounding the meront was irregular and indented. The mean prevalence was 18.3% and it varied according to season and locality. The distribution of prevalence according to fish size indicated that small fish were primarily affected.

Potaspora aequidens,"Potaspora aequidens n. sp. (Microsporidia, Tetramicridae), a parasite infecting the freshwater fish Aequidens plagiozonatus (Teleostei, Cichlidae) from Brazil. Morphological and molecular procedures were used to describe a new species of microsporidian that infects the muscles of the sub-opercular region and the caudal fins of the freshwater Aequidens plagiozonatus in Brazil. This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas containing variable number of spores, reaching up to ~0.4 mm in diameter. The mature spores, pyriformin shape, with slightly round ends, measured 3.4 ± 0.5 μm long and 1.9 ± 0.3 μm wide (n = 50) and showed characteristics typical of Microsporidia. The average thickness of the spore wall was 100 (96–108) nm (n = 50), and the spore wall was composed of two layers, a thin, electron-dense exospore and a thick electron-transparent endospore. The exospore was surrounded by a thin, irregular layer of granular material. The anchoring disc was mushroom-like, located in the apical region of the spore in an eccentric position relative to the spore axis, rendering bilateral asymmetry to the spore. The anterior part of the polar filament (PF) (manubrium) measured approximately 125 (122–128) nm thick (n = 30), and the angle of tilt between the anterior PF and the spore axis was ~45°; the posterior part was packed in 8–9 coils. Phylogenetic analysis showed a strongly supported clade containing family Spragueidae Weissenberg, 1976, family Tetramicridae Matthews and Matthews, 1980, Microsporidium sp. RBS1, and Kabatana spp. In conclusion, the available morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular data shows that this microsporidian is a new species belonging to group 4, classified as Potaspora aequidens n. sp.

Potaspora macrobrachium,"A new microsporidium, Potaspora macrobrachium n.sp. infecting the musculature of pond-reared oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense (Decapoda: Palaemonidae). This paper described a novel microsporidian infection in the pond-reared oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense. A conspicuous symptom of the infection was progressive white opacity associated with the musculature. Although neither bacteria nor viruses were detected in routine diagnostic tests, apparently degenerated microsporidian cells or spores were frequently observed in wet smears of the musculature from diseased prawns. Histological observations also revealed characteristics typical of microsporidian infection throughout the host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed multiple life stages of a microsporidian parasite within the cytoplasm of host muscle cells. In addition, partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was obtained by a nested PCR using microsporidian specific primers. A consensus sequence was then deposited in GenBank (accession no. KU307278) and subjected to a general BLASTn search that yielded hits only for microsporidian sequence records. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate was most similar to the fish microsporidian clade containing the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Teramicra. The highest sequence identity, 87%, was with Potaspora spp. Based on histological, ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic data, we erected a new species, Potaspora macrobrachium for the novel microsporidium. The description of microsporidium in this important commercial host was fundamental for future consideration of factors affecting stock health and sustainability.",Potaspora macrobrachium,Macrobrachium nipponense,skeletal muscles; cardiac muscles,NA,skeletal muscles; cardiac muscles,NA,musculature,NA
Potaspora morhaphis,"A new microsporidian parasite, Potaspora morhaphis n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporidia) infecting the Teleostean fish, Potamorhaphis guianensis from the River Amazon. Morphological, ultrastructural and molecular characterization. SUMMARY A fish-infecting Microsporidia Potaspora morhaphis n. gen., n. sp. found adherent to the wall of the coelomic cavity of the freshwater fish, Potamorhaphis guianensis, from lower Amazon River is described, based on light microscope and ultrastructural characteristics. This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas distinguished by the numerous filiform and anastomosed microvilli. The xenoma was completely filled by several developmental stages. In all of these stages, the nuclei are monokaryotic and develop in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The merogonial plasmodium divides by binary fission and the disporoblastic pyriform spores of sporont origin measure 2·8±0·3×1·5±0·2 μm. In mature spores the polar filament was arranged into 9–10 coils in 2 layers. The polaroplast had 2 distinct regions around the manubrium and an electron-dense globule was observed. The small subunit, intergenic space and partial large subunit rRNA gene were sequenced and maximum parsimony analysis placed the microsporidian described here in the clade that includes the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Spraguea and Tetramicra. The ultrastructural morphology of the xenoma, and the developmental stages including the spores of this microsporidian parasite, as well as the phylogenetic analysis, suggest the erection of a new genus and species.",Potaspora morhaphis,Potamorhaphis guianensis,intestinal,NA,intestinal,NA,coelomic cavity,NA
Pseudokabatana alburnus,"Pseudokabatana alburnus n. gen. n. sp., (Microsporidia) from the liver of topmouth culter Culter alburnus (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae) from China. We describe the type species of a novel genus of microsporidian parasite, Pseudokabatana alburnus n. gen. n. sp., infecting the liver of topmouth culter, Culter alburnus Basilewsky, 1855, from Lake Poyang off Xingzi county, Jiangxi Province, China. The parasite elicits formation of spherical xenomas of up to 1.2 mm in diameter containing all observed life stages from early merogonal plasmodia to mature spores contained within the cytoplasm of host hepatocytes. Merogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host cytoplasm and contained up to 20 visible nuclei. Plasmotomy of the multinucleate plasmodium led to formation of uninucleate cells in which the nucleus underwent further division to form bi-nucleate presporonts, sporonts (defined by cells with a thickened endospore) and eventually sporoblasts (containing pre-cursors of the spore extrusion apparatus). Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 2.3 ± 0.19 μm long and 1.3 ± 0.10 μm wide. Spores possessed a bipartite polaroplast and 5–6 coils of a polar filament, in a single rank. The obtained partial SSU rRNA gene sequence, 1383 bp in length, did not match any of microsporidia available in GenBank. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated a new taxon branching with Kabatana rondoni, a parasite infecting the skeletal muscle of Gymnorhamphichthys rondoni from the Amazon River. Due to different host and tissue tropism, the novel taxon did not fit the diagnostic criteria for the genus Kabatana. Further, based on SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, different ultrastructural features of developmental stages, and ecological considerations, a new genus Pseudokabatana and type species Pseudokabatana alburnus n. sp. was erected for the parasite in topmouth culter.",Pseudokabatana alburnus,Culter alburnus,Hepatocytes of Liver,NA,Hepatocytes of Liver,NA,liver,NA

Rugispora istanbulensis,"Description and phylogeny of a new microsporidium from the elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola Muller, 1766 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). This study describes a new genus and species of microsporidia which is a pathogen of the elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola Muller, 1776 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The beetles were collected from Istanbul in Turkey. All developmental stages are uninucleate and in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Giemsa-stained mature spores are oval in shape and measured 3.40 ± 0.37 μm in length and 1.63 ± 0.20 μm in width. These uninucleate spores have an isofilar polar filament with 11 turns. The spore wall was trilaminar (75 to 115 nm) with a rugose, electron-dense exospore (34 to 45 nm) and a thickened, electron-lucent endospore (65 to 80 nm) overlaying the plasmalemma. Morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular features indicate that the described microsporidium is dissimilar to all known microsporidian taxa and confirm that it has different taxonomic characters than other microsporidia infecting X. luteola and is named here as Rugispora istanbulensis n. gen., n. sp.",Rugispora istanbulensis,Xanthogaleruca luteola,Midgut epithelium,NA,Midgut epithelium,NA,NA,NA
Schroedera airthreyi,"Development and Molecular Characterisation of the Microsporidian Schroedera airthreyi n. sp. in a Freshwater Bryozoan Plumatella sp. (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata). Abstract. The development of a new species of microsporidian, infecting a freshwater Plumatellid bryozoan, is described. The small-subunit rDNA, internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and partial large-subunit rDNA genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the parasite clustered with Schroedera plumatellae. However, while there were morphological affinities with this species, significant differences were also observed. The infection initially appeared as a roughening of the peritoneum lining the metacoelom of the bryozoan. This roughening resolved into meront-infected syncytia, composed of interconnected cells of the body wall that detached to float in the coleomic cavity. Spores were observed to develop within these syncytia. All stages of development were diplokaryotic in contrast to S. plumatellae, which has a distinct monokaryotic merogony preceding sporogony. The infection was pathogenic to the host. Direct bryozoan–bryozoan transmission was not observed. We propose to name the microsporidian Schroedera aithreyi n. sp.",Schroedera airthreyi,Plumatella sp.,muscle,NA,muscle,NA,peritoneum,NA
Schroedera plumatellae,"Development of Schroedera plumatellae gen. n., sp. n. (Microsporidia) in Plumatella fungosa (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata). A new microsporidian, Schroedera plumatellae, is described infecting a freshwater bryozoan. The development of the infection is described both at the light and ultrastructural level. The infection induces the formation of hyperplastic testes within the bryozoan host from which cord-like xenomas form. Development of diplokaryotic sporonts is preceded by haplophasic schizogony. Sporogony forms diplokaryotic spores. The spores formed within the xenomas are oval, tapering to one end and were 7.2 ± 0.3 μm by 5.0 ± 0.3 μm with 22-23 turns of the polar filament. Sporogony occurred within the hyaloplasm with the exospore developing into two distinct layers.

Sporanauta perivermis,"Microsporidian Infection in a Free-Living Marine Nematode. Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites. Although nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse animal groups, the only confirmed report of microsporidian infection was that of the “nematode killer” (Nematocida parisii). N. parisii was isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis sp. and causes an acute and lethal intestinal infection in a lab strain of Caenorhabditis elegans. We set out to characterize a microsporidian infection in a wild nematode to determine whether the infection pattern of N. parisii in the lab is typical of microsporidian infections in nematodes. We describe a novel microsporidian species named Sporanauta perivermis (marine spore of roundworms) and characterize its infection in its natural host, the free-living marine nematode Odontophora rectangula. S. perivermis is not closely related to N. parisii and differs strikingly in all aspects of infection. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the infection was localized in the hypodermal and muscle tissues only and did not involve the intestines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed infection in the muscle and hypodermis, and surprisingly, it also revealed that the parasite infects O. rectangula eggs, suggesting a vertical mode of transmission. Our observations highlight the importance of studying parasites in their natural hosts and indicate that not all nematode-infecting microsporidia are “nematode killers”; instead, microsporidiosis can be more versatile and chronic in the wild.",Sporanauta perivermis,Odontophora rectangula,Hypoderm; muscles; egg; and the reproductive tissues of juveniles,NA,muscles; and the reproductive tissues of juveniles,NA,muscle,NA
Takaokaspora nipponicus,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a microsporidian parasite, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. from the invasive rock pool mosquito, Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus. Graphical abstract Highlights • A new genus and species of Microsporidia is described from mosquitoes. • The microsporidium is vertically and horizontally transmitted and exhibits dimorphic development. • Development in vertically-infected larvae is fatal and results in the formation of uninucleate conical spores. • Horizontal transmission occurs via oral ingestion of spores produced in vertically-infected larvae. • The SSU rDNA sequence of the microsporidium is unique from all other mosquito-parasitic species. Abstract A new genus and species of Microsporidia, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. is described from Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (Theobald) and Ochlerotatus hatorii (Yamada) based on light microscope and ultrastructural morphology, developmental features, transmission cycles and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). The microsporidium is both vertically and horizontally transmitted, exhibits dimorphic development alternating between diplokaryotic and monokaryotic stages and produces two morphologically distinct spores, one in larvae and another in adult females. Horizontal transmission of infection to larval mosquitoes occurs via direct oral ingestion of uninucleate spores that are produced in vertically-infected larval hosts. Development in horizontally-infected hosts is diplokaryotic following karyokinesis of uninucleate schizonts and binary fission to produce small (4.3μm×2.0μm) membrane free, ovoid, binucleate spores that are confined to adult female reproductive tissues (ovariole sheath and oviducts). Vertical transmission of the microsporidium from adult females to larval progeny takes place via surface contamination of the egg (transovum). Microsporidian development in vertically-infected larvae is haplophasic with unpaired nuclei throughout, producing rosette-shaped sporogonial plasmodia contained within a thin non-persistent sporophorous vesicle and culminating in the formation of membrane free, uninucleate, conical spores (7.0μm×2.8μm). Development is confined to host fat body tissue which appears as swollen white masses in the thorax and selected segments of the abdomen causing larvae to appear abnormally distorted and results in death during the third and fourth instar stages. The SSU rDNA sequences obtained from the two morphologically identical microsporidia isolated from Oc. j. japonicus and Oc. hatorii were nearly identical and unique when compared with GenBank entries of all other mosquito-parasitic species. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and bootstrap analyses using the Neighbor Joining search parameter yielded similar typologies. In each case, the novel microsporidium was the sister group to the clade containing Parathelohania species from Anopheles mosquitoes and the monotypic Novothelohania ovalae from Ochlerotatus caspius showing approximately 10–13% sequence divergence to those two genera providing strong support for establishment as a separate genus.",Takaokaspora nipponicus,Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus; Ochlerotatus hatorii,adipose of larvae; gonads,vertical trans.,adipose of larvae; gonads,NA,"Ovariole sheath (Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus, Ochlerotatus hatorii); oviducts (Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus, Ochlerotatus hatorii); fat body (Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus, Ochlerotatus hatorii)",NA

Trachipleistophora hominis,"Myositis associated with a newly described microsporidian, Trachipleistophora hominis, in a patient with AIDS. Microsporidia are zoonotic protozoa which were rare human pathogens prior to 1985, when Enterocytozoon bieneusi was described in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with chronic diarrhea. Another species, Encephalitozoon (Septata) intestinalis, is associated with diarrhea and chronic sinusitis, and approximately 25 cases have been reported in the literature. However, other microsporidial infections in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients remain extremely rare. We report the first case of a Pleistophora sp.-like microsporidian infection presenting as a progressive severe myosotis associated with fever and weight loss. The organism was demonstrated by light microscopy and electron microscopy in corneal scrapings, skeletal muscle, and nasal discharge. Electron microscopy showed an electron-dense surface coat with ''sun-flare''-like projections surrounding all stages of development of meronts (two to four nuclei, dividing by binary fission), sporonts, and sporoblasts. Division of sporonts, in which sporonts separate from the thick outer coat, creating a sporophorous vesicle, is by binary fission, differentiating this organism from Pleistophora sp. The spore measures 4.0 by 2.5 mu m and has a rugose exospore. A new genus and species, Trachipleistophora hominis, has been established for this parasite.

Trachipleistophora sp.,"A Trachipleistophora-like microsporidium of man: Its dimorphic nature and relationship to Thelohania apodemi. The structure of the human microsporidium found by Yachnis and colleagues in two AIDS patients (Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 106: 535-43, 1996) (hereafter referred to as HMY) was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy and compared with Thelohania apodemi Doby, Jeannes et Raoult, 1963, a microsporidian of small rodents. The fine structure of the HMY was found to be similar to that of Trachipleistophora hominis Hollister, Canning, Weldner, Field, Kench et Marriott, 1996. Characteristic is the presence of a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of the meront plasmalemma, which is maintained during the whole life cycle and which later persists as an electron dense coat on the sporophorous vesicle (SPOV). However, HMY is distinguished from T. hominis during sporogony, as two types of SPOV and spores are formed in HMY. One type of SPOV contains thick-walled spores (usually 8 or more in number) with anisofilar polar filaments of 7 + 2 pattern, while the other type contains only two thin-walled spores with a smaller number (3-5) of isofilar polar filament coils. The HMY differs from T. apodemi which also forms SPOV with 8 spores inside, but the spores of which are larger in size and have 9 + 2 polar filament pattern.",NA,AIDS patients,brain; kidney,NA,brain; kidney,NA,NA,NA

Trichotuzetia guttata,"Light and electron microscopic cytology of Trichotuzetia guttata gen. et. sp. n. (Microspora, Tuzetiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Cyclops vicinus Uljanin, 1875 (Crustacea, Copepoda). The microsporidium Trichotuzetia guttata gen. et sp. n., a parasite of the copepod Cyclops vicinus in the Czech Republic, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. In the merogonial reproduction multinucleate plasmodia divide by plasmotomy, yielding uninucleate merozoites. Sporonts develop into multinucleate plasmodia, which split in a rosette-like manner, initially into wide lobes with large nuclei, finally into narrow lobes with small nuclei. Sporoblasts are formed in individual sporophorous vesicles generated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Immature sporogonial stages are covered by fibrillar projections uniting the exospore with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Mature spores, which are pyriform with pointed anterior end, normally lack projections. Unfixed spores measure 4.6-5.7x2.7-3.3 urn. The exospore is four-layered. The anterior lamellae of the polaroplast are wide. The posterior ones (present in a short zone) are narrow close to the filament, wider at the periphery. The polar filament is isofilar with 9-10, 102-131 nm wide, coils in a single layer close to the spore wall in posterior half of the spore. The angle of tilt is 60-65°. Isometric, 21-25 nm wide virus-like particles were observed in the nuclei of mature spores. Experimental transmission of the microsporidium per os has failed. The small subunit rRNA gene has been sequenced and the data have been used in a phylogenetic analysis (PAUP).

Tricornia muhezae,"Ultrastructure of Tricornia muhezae N. G., n. sp. (Microspora, Thelohaniidae), a parasite of Mansonia africana (Diptera: Culicidae) from Tanzania. Collections of Mansonia africana mosquito larvae were made at one site in N.E. Tanzania in 1985 and 1987 and from two additional sites, both within about 2 mi of the original one in 1987. An octosporous microsporidian, present at all three sites, was found in both years infecting from 7 to 22% of larvae. Spores (stained in Giemsa) measured 3.0 microns +/- 0.25 microns x 2.25 microns +/- 0.26 microns. Ultrastructurally, spores were seen to have an anterior rim surrounding a depressed area where the endospore was at its thinnest. In transmission electron microscopy section, the rim appeared as two processes into which all layers of the wall extended. At the posterior end all layers of the wall extended into a simple knob-like structure which could be interpreted as a section through a crest running longitudinally around the spore. The polar filament was anisofilar, with two anterior coils of greater diameter than the three posterior coils. Although most closely resembling the genera Amblyspora and Parathelohania in the family Thelohaniidae, the species in M. africana differs from the former, which has oval spores, broadly rounded at the ends, and from the latter, which has a prominent, ridged posterior extension to the spores.

Tubulinosema hippodamiae (1),"Ultrastructure and molecular characterization of a microsporidium, Tubulinosema hippodamiae, from the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville. Graphical abstract Research highlights ► The genomic sequence of the microsporidium was 98–99% similar to Tubulinosema. ► Pathogen ultrastructure is similar to those that define the genus Tubulinosema. ► Aberrant spores filled with lamellar or vesicular structures were observed. ► Host range and tissue pathology overlap with microsporidia from other coccinellids. ► This pathogen may be Nosema hippodamiae, described in 1959 by light microscopy. Abstract Hippodamia convergens, the convergent lady beetle, is available for aphid control in home gardens and in commercial food production systems throughout the United States and Canada. Beetles received from commercial insectaries for biological control are occasionally infected with a microsporidium. The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen by means of ultrastructure, molecular characterization and tissue pathology. All stages of the microsporidium were in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Early developmental stages were proximal to mature spores and both were observed throughout the tissue sections that were examined. Merogony resulted from binary fission. Early-stage sporoblasts were surrounded by a highly convoluted plasma membrane and contained an electron-dense cytoplasm and diplokaryon. Ovoid to elongated late-stage sporoblasts were surrounded by a relatively complete spore wall. The polar filament, polaroplast, and anchoring disk were readily observed within the cell cytoplasm. Mature spores were typical of terrestrial microsporidia, with a thickened endospore surrounded by a thin exospore. Spores contained well-defined internal structures, including a diplokaryon, lamellar polaroplast and a slightly anisofilar polar filament with 10–14 coils arranged in a single or double row. A prominent indentation was evident at the apical end of the spore wall proximal to the anchoring disk. Aberrant spores were also observed. These had a fully developed endospore and exospore but lacked any discernable internal spore structures, and were, instead, filled with lamellar or vesicular structures. Typical and aberrant spores measured 3.58±0.2×2.06±0.2μm (n=10) and 3.38±0.8×2.13±0.2μm (n=10), respectively. Spores were observed in longitudinal muscle surrounding the midgut and within the fat body, Malpighian tubules, pyloric valve epithelium, ventral nerve cord ganglia, muscles and ovaries. The hindgut epithelium was often infected but the connective tissues were rarely invaded. The life cycle and pathology of the microsporidium bears some resemblance to Nosema hippodamiae, the only microsporidium reported from H. convergens by Lipa and Steinhaus in 1959. Molecular characterization of the pathogen genomic DNA revealed that it is 99% similar to Tubulinosema acridophagus and T. ratisbonensis, two pathogens that infect Drosophila melanogaster and 98% similar to T. kingi from D. willistoni. Based on similarities in pathogen ultrastructure and the molecular information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in H. convergens be given the name Tubulinosema hippodamiae.",Tubulinosema hippodamiae,Hippodamia convergens,adipose; muscle; midgut; hindgut; nervous; Malphigian; epithelium; connective; ovarian; pyloric valve epithelium,NA,adipose; nervous; Malphigian; ovarian,NA,fat body; ovaries;  Malpighian tubules; ventral nerve cord ganglia,NA

Nosema maroccanus Krilova et Nurzhanov, 1987 was isolated from the Moroccan locust Dociostaurus maroccanus Thunb. in Uzbekistan. Its description, based on one of the first ultrastructural studies of microsporidia from orthopteran hosts, lacked information on the details of cell surface structure, which are considered to be very important in modern taxonomy. We have re-investigated the material upon which the original description of N. maroccanus was based and revealed new ultrastructural characters of its cell surface. Late meronts are surrounded with microtubuli, about 20 nm in diameter, attached to the membrane, later replaced with electron dense granules, forming a typical coating of the sporont's surface (the primordium of exospore). Mature spores are also surrounded with a layer of microtubuli. Host cell cytoplasm contains small vesicles with electron-dense cores, up to 50 nm in diameter, surrounding late meronts, sporogonial stages and spores of the parasite. Polar tube is slightly anisofilar. These characters disagree with the diagnosis of Nosema, but fit that of the recently established genus Tubulinosema. Hence, we transferred the species studied into this genus, establishing Tubulinosema maroccanus comb. nov. Analysis of cell surface ultrastructure of two Tubulinosema species from Orthoptera showed that they shared two characters not mentioned in the diagnosis of the genus. Therefore, the diagnosis of Tubulinosema was modified to include two more characters: presence of vesicles with electron-dense cores surrounding sporogonial stages and presence of microtubuli not only in late meronts, but also, in some species, in spores.",Tubulinosema maroccanus,Dociostaurus maroccanus,general,including germline tissues,general,including germline tissues,NA,NA

Unnamed Enterospora sp.,"Enterospora sp., an intranuclear microsporidian infection of hermit crab Eupagurus bernhardus. Recent work at our laboratory has led to the discovery of a new genus of microsporidian parasite residing in the family Enterocytozoonidae. The type species of this new genus, Enterospora canceri, is an intranuclear parasite infecting the hepatopancreatocytes of the decapod crustacean Cancer pagurus. Here we provide the second description of a parasite within the genus Enterospora, this time infecting the hermit crab Eupagurus bernhardus from UK waters. The pathological manifestation and ultrastructural features of the hermit crab parasite are very similar to those described for E. canceri. Further taxonomic comparisons based upon ultrastructural and molecular affinities of Enterospora are now required to define firmer links between this new genus within the Enterocytozoonidae and all other microsporidian families.

unnamed microsporidium 3,"Cellular distribution of a feminizing microsporidian parasite: a strategy for transovarial transmission. The cellular distribution of a vertically transmitted, feminizing microsporidian was followed in its host Gammarus duebeni.

Spores were diplokaryotic with a thin spore wall and a short polar filament, characteristics typical of 'early' spores involved in autoinfection. The diplokaryotic life-cycle, absence of spore groupings and of a pansporoblast membrane typify the genus Nosema. However, the unusual globular polaroplast of the spore and restriction of this stage to host ovarian tissue, have not previously been described in Nosema. Sporogony occurred only in follicle cells adjacent to developing oocytes and was in synchrony with the process of vitellogenesis. Oocytes were infected after formation of intracellular connections with follicle cells but harboured only vegetative stages of the parasite. Parasites were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm and, in developing embryos, segregated to daughter cells along the axis of the spindle.

SUMMARY In this paper, we describe the occurrence of a microsporidian parasite in female-biased populations of an intertidal amphipod, Corophium volutator (Pallas), at mudflat sites in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Sequence data for the parasite's 16S rDNA indicate that it is a novel microsporidian species. This parasite was found principally in female host gonads, indicating that it might be a vertically transmitted, sex-distorting microparasite. At 4 sites each sampled in early and mid-summer, parasite prevalence varied from 0 to 21%. In the lab, infected mothers gave rise to more female-biased broods, than did uninfected mothers. Infection was not associated with size of females or with lowered survivorship of their young. Surprisingly, infected mothers actually had higher fertility controlling for body length than did uninfected mothers. Taken together, our results suggest that this novel microsporidian is likely a feminizing microparasite and is a contributing factor to local and widespread sex ratio distortion in C.

Unnamed Nosema sp. 3,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new microsporidian (Protozoa: Microsporidia) isolated from Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). A microsporidium was isolated from larvae of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) collected from Tamil Nadu, India. This microsporidian species is monomorphic, disporous and develops in direct contact with the cytoplasm of the host cell. The nuclear configuration of merogonic and sporogonic stages was diplokaryotic. The merogonic proliferative stage was unusual that normal development with 1, 2 and 4 binucleated forms were common, while large multinucleate meronts containing 8 and 12 small compact horseshoe-like diplokaryotic nuclei were also observed. The fresh spores were typically ovocylindrical in shape, with a mean size of 3·91×1·91 μm and the polar filament length was ~90 μm. Infection was systemic with mature spores produced in the midgut, nervous tissue, muscles, labial glands, gonads, tracheae, epidermis, Malpighian tubules and, most extensively, fat body tissues. The new isolate was highly pathogenic to S. litura larvae. Host specificity tests performed on 37 non-target hosts of 5 different insect orders revealed that the new isolate is pathogenic only to lepidopteran insects. We sequenced the 16S small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene of the isolate and compared it with 72 non-redundant microsporidian sequences from the GenBank. Based on the light microscopic studies and phylogenetic analyses, the new isolate is assigned to the genus Nosema. Significant differences in the SSU rRNA sequence were identified when compared with the type species Nosema bombycis and other closely related species viz., Nosema spodopterae. Structural differences were also observed in the 16S SSU rRNA between the new isolate and the two above-mentioned microsporidian pathogens.

A study was undertaken to isolate entomopathogens of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyer, and southern corn stalk borer, Diatraea crambidoides (Grote). Field- collected diapausing larvae of southwestern corn borer (three sites in Mississippi) and southern corn stalk borer (one site in North Carolina), and a laboratory strain of D. grandiosella in the diapause state were maintained in a simulated winter followed by a simulated spring environment. Few larvae (#6%) collected from any of the Þeld sites died in the winter environment, and most insect mortality (11Ð25%) occurred after transfer of the larvae to the simulated spring environment. Mortality during the simulated spring period differed among the collection sites, and the highest mortality was recorded for southwestern corn borers from Washington County (25%), followed by Marshall (16%) and Oktibbeha (11%) Counties. A high level of mortality was also observed in southern corn stalk borers during the simulated spring period (27%). No viruses were observed, but a number of bacteria, microsporidia, and fungi were isolated from both southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae. In most instances, numerous bacterial taxa were isolated from cadavers, but on some occasions a single taxon predominated. The most prevalent bacterial taxon from larval and pupal cadavers was Enterococcus faecalis (Andrewes & Horder) Schleifer & Kilpper-Balz, but Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula, and Serratia marcescens Bizio were frequently isolated as well.

Unnamed Vairimorpha sp.,"First detection of a microsporidium in the crucifer pest Hellula undalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)—a possible control agent?. For the first time, a microsporidian infection was observed in the pest species Hellula undalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija, Philippines. Because H. undalis is difficult to control by chemical insecticides and microbiological control techniques have not been established, we investigated the biology, the pathogenicity and transmission of this pathogen found in H. undalis. An average of 16% of larvae obtained from crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija displayed microsporidian infections and 75% of infected H. undalis died during larval development. Histopathological studies revealed that the infection is initiated in the midgut and then spreads to all organs. The microsporidium has two different sporulation sequences: a disporoblastic development producing binucleate free mature spores and an octosporoblastic development forming eight uninucleate spores. These two discrete life cycles imply its taxonomic assignment to the genus Vairimorpha. The size of the binucleate, diplokaryotic spores as measured on Giemsa-stained smears was 3.56±0.29μm in length and 2.18±0.21μm in width, whereas the uninucleate octospores measured 2.44±0.20×1.64±0.14μm. The microsporidium was orally and probably also transovarially transmitted. Laboratory infection tests by feeding spores on artificial diet to 3rd instars resulted in 100% infection with a final mortality of 80%.

(Microsporidia: Burenellidae) and Thelohania contejeani (Microsporidia: Thelohaniidae), two parasites of the white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes complex (Decapoda: Astacidae). The microsporidiosis of the endangered white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes complex has generally been attributed to only one species, Thelohania contejeani, the agent of porcelain disease. Species identification was mostly assessed by macroscopic examination or microscopic evaluation of muscle samples rather than by molecular or ultrastructural analyses. A survey conducted on A. pallipes complex populations in Northern Italy highlighted the presence of two different microsporidia causing similar muscular lesions, T. contejeani and an undescribed octosporoblastic species Vairimorpha austropotamobii sp. nov. Mature spores and earlier developmental stages of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, which gave rise to a rosette-shaped plasmodium, and eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent SPV. Ultrastructural features of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were pyriform in shape and an average of 3.9 × 2.2 µm in size. The polar filament was coiled 11–14 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) and the large subunit RNA polymerase II gene (RPB1) of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were sequenced and compared with other microsporidia. The highest sequence identity of SSU rRNA (99%) and RPB1 (74%) genes was with the amphipod parasite Nosema granulosis and subsequently with V. cheracis, which infects the Australian yabby Cherax destructor. In our work we discuss about the reasons for placing this new species in the genus Vairimorpha. In addition, we provide for T. contejeani a RPB1 gene sequence, supplemental sequences of SSU rRNA gene and ultrastructural details of its sporogony in the host A. pallipes complex.",Vairimorpha austropotamobii,Austropotamobius pallipes,skeletal muscle tissue of male and female host,NA,skeletal muscle tissue of male and female host,NA,striated muscle cells; thorax; abdomen; appendages,NA
Vairimorpha ceraces,"A NEW MICROSPORIDIUM(MICROSPOREDIA,BURENELLIDAE) FROM THE INSECT OF LEPIDOPTERA, CERACE STIPATANA (WALKER). A previously undescribed microsporidum is isolated from the Cerace stipatana (Walker) in October 2000, in Langzhong, Sichuan Province, China. We describe this microsporidium as a new species of Vairimorpha, and name it as Vairimorpha ceraces sp.nov. According to taxonomy system (Sprague, 1992), it belongs to Phylum Microspora, Class Dihalophasea, Order meiodihalophasea and Family Burenellidae. Type Host. Cerace stipatana Walker (Lepidop- tera, Tortricoidea). Site of Infection. Infection to midgut epithelial and muscle cells, fat body, derma cell. Type Locality. Langzhong, Sichuan Province(32°N,105°E),China. Prevalence of infection. Seventy-five of three hundred larvae, Cerace stipatana examined were infected (25%). Diagnosis. Spore is oval in shape and 3.1μm±0.3μm(2.5-3.5μm)×1.6μm±0.2μm(1.5-1.9μm) in size. Binucleate spore with 10 to 12 coils of polar filaments,and uninucleate spore with 7 to 9 coils. The spore size and polar filament coil numbers are smaller than other species of Vairimorpha. Developmental cycle passes merogony stage and sporogony stage. Meronts are spherical in shape and multiplication depend the binary fission of meront nucleus. Sporonts are binucleate and fusiform. Sporogony includes not only octosporoblast form with uninucleate spore but also bispores form with binucleate spore. Interface feature between the microsporidium and host cytoplansm showing that meronts, sporont and bisporoblasts are face to face. But sporonts form octospores when it is enclosed by the sporphorous membrane. Type specimens.

Vairimorpha cheracis,"Ultrastructural characteristics and small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence of Vairimorpha cheracis sp. nov., (Microspora: Burenellidae), a parasite of the Australian yabby, Cherax destructor (Decapoda: Parastacidae). This is the first record of a species of Vairimorpha infecting a crustacean host. Vairimorpha cheracis sp. nov. was found in a highland population of the Australian freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor. The majority of spores and earlier developmental stages of V. cheracis sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, each of which gave rise to four sporoblasts in a rosette-shaped plasmodium, so that eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent ovoid SPV. Ultrastructural features of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were pyriform in shape and averaged 3.4×1.9μm in dimensions. The anterior polaroplast was lamellar in structure, and the posterior polaroplast vesicular. The polar filament was coiled 10–12 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) of V. cheracis sp. nov. was sequenced and compared with other microsporidia. V. cheracis sp. nov. showed over 97% sequence identity with Vairimorpha imperfecta and five species of Nosema, and only 86% sequence identity with V. necatrix.

Vairimorpha imperfecta,"Vairimorpha imperfecta n.sp., a microsporidian exhibiting an abortive octosporous sporogony in Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae). The microsporidian genus Nosema is characterized by development in direct control with host cell cytoplasm, diplokaryotic nuclei throughout development and disporous sporogony. The genus Vairimorpha exhibits the same features plus an octoporous sporogony producing uninucleate spores in a sporophorous vesicle. A microsporidium from diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, falls between Nosema and Vairimorpha in that it initiates but fails to complete the octosporous sequence in this host. The name Vairimorpha imperfecta n.sp. is proposed. Merogony is mainly by formation of buds from multinucleate meronts, the buds remaining attached in chains. Diplokaryotic spores measure 4.3 x 2.0 microns (fresh) and have 15.5 coils of the polar tube in 1 rank. The octosporous sporogony is aborted owing to irregular formation of nuclear spindles, incomplete cytoplasmic fission and bizarre deposition of electron-dense episporontal secretions. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the small subunit rRNA genes of V. imperfecta and of several Nosema and Vairimorpha spp. place V. imperfecta in a clade with Nosema spp. from Lepidoptera rather than in the clade containing the more typical species of Vairimorpha. It is suggested that the ancestors of the Vairimorpha/Nosema complex of species exhibited both disporous and octosporous sporogonies, as does the type species of Vairimorpha, Vairimorpha necatrix. It would follow that true Nosema spp. have lost the ability to express an octosporous sequence and that V. imperfecta is in the process of losing it. It is proposed that the genera Nosema and Vairimorpha be placed in the same family Nosematidae Labbé 1899, rather than in separate families and orders as at present.",Vairimorpha imperfecta,Plutella xylostella,systemic infection; fat body; midgut epithelium,NA,systemic infection; fat body; midgut epithelium,NA,NA,NA
Vairimorpha necatrix BM,"Morphological and molecular studies of Vairimorpha necatrix BM, a new strain of the microsporidium V. necatrix (microsporidia, burenellidae) recorded in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Graphical abstract Highlights • This is a new study on the Vairimorpha necatrix recorder in the silkworm Bombyx mori. • Diplokaryotic spores (4.7±0.2×2.1±0.2μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 13–17 coils. • Almost all the tissues of silkworm were the targets for Vairimorpha necatrix BM but no infection in the ovary. • There is no vertical transmission in silkworm after Vairimorpha necatrix BM infection. Abstract Vairimorpha sp. BM (2012) is a recent isolate of the microsporidia from the silkworm in Shandong, China. The ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization of this isolate is described in this study. This pathogenic fungus causes pebrine disease in silkworms which manifests as a systemic infection. Meanwhile, the silkworm eggs produced by the infected moths were examined using a microscope and PCR amplification. Neither spores nor the expected PCR band were observed, suggesting that no vertical transmission occurred in Bombyx mori. In addition, the ultrastructure of the isolate was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two types of spores were observed: diplokaroytic spores with 13–17 coils of polar tubes and monokaryotic spores with less coils of polar tubes which could form octospores; however, no sporophorous vesicles were observed. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA genes of Vairimorpha species showed that this isolate has a closer relationship to Vairimorpha necatrix than the other species studied. This result also is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on their actin genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and RNA polymerase II (RPB1). Based on the information gained during this study, we propose that this microsporidian species infecting B. mori should be given the name V. necatrix BM.",Vairimorpha necatrix BM,Bombyx mori,midgut; Malpighian tubules; fat body; silk glands; muscles; testis,NA,midgut; Malpighian tubules; fat body; silk glands; muscles; testis,NA,NA,NA
Vairimorpha ocinarae,"A new microsporidian species, Vairimorpha ocinarae n. sp., isolated from Ocinara lida Moore (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) in Taiwan. Abstract A new microsporidium was isolated from Ocinara lida Moore (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), a pest of Ficus microcarpa L. f. in Taiwan. The microsporidium produces systemic infections in O. lida larvae; the midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, and midgut muscle tissues were the target tissues for this isolate, and atrophied fat body tissues were found in heavily infected larvae. Two types of spores were observed, diplokaroytic spores with 11–13 coils of polar tube, and monokaryotic spores with 12 coils of the polar tube that developed within a sporophorous vesicle to form octospores. Electron-dense granules were abundant in the episporontal space of the sporophorous vesicles, and were similar to those of Vairimorpha invictae isolated from Solenopsis invicta, but different from granules or inclusions of other Vairimorpha species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence, this isolate is unique within the Vairimorpha complex. Morphological and genetic characters showed this isolate to be a new species.

Vairimorpha sp. (NIS M12),"Infection and development of vairimorpha sp. NIS M12(microsporida: Protozoa) in a lepidopteran cell line. Vairimorpha sp. NIS M12, a microsporidian parasite isolated from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, successfully infected the cell line of Spodoptera frugiperda SF21AE II. After priming with 0.1N KOH solution, the spores were mixed thoroughly with S. frugiperda cells suspended in Rinaldini's solution. Inoculated cells were cultured at 28°C in IPL-41 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At a ratio of 30 spores per cell, 9.1% of S. frugiperda cells were infected initially with sporoplasms 1hr postinoculation. About 65% of the infected cells harbored a single sporoplasm. The spread of infection and spore production of V. sp. NIS M12 in cell cultures were markedly different from those of Nosema bombycis, while the in vitro life cycles of the two parasites was similar. Short-coiled spores occurred 72hr postinoculation, and longcoiled mature spores were produced 10 days postinoculation.

Vairimorpha sp. 1,"Impact of Vairimorpha sp. (Microsporidia: Burnellidae) on Trichogramma chilonis (Hymenoptera, Trichogrammatidae), a hymenopteran parasitoid of the cabbage moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae). A multi-generation mass breeding colony of the cabbage moth, Plutella xylostella, was found to be infected with a microsporidium, Vairimorpha sp., which is passed transovarially between generations. The microsporidian infection had little impact on the fitness of this lepidopteran pest. However, when Trichogramma chilonis parasitized such infected host eggs, the offspring of this parasitoid species suffered from severe deficiencies. Microsporidian spores, ingested by parasitoid larvae together with the host egg nutrients, gave rise to stages which developed in various tissues of the parasitoid, such as the flight muscle and the nervous system. This infection resulted in a significantly increased rate of metamorphosis failure (related to host age) and reduced longevity and reproductive performance of the parasitoids. There are two main consequences arising from our findings if T. chilonis is to be used in an integrated control strategy against P. xylostella: (1) T. chilonis must be raised on Vairimorpha-free host eggs to receive viable and efficaceous parasitoids for release and (2) if natural populations of the cabbage moth in cruciferous crops are infected with Vairimorpha to a significant extent, the parasitoid must be released repeatedly within infested crop areas.",Vairimorpha sp.,Trichogramma chilonis,flight muscles; nervous system; egg,NA,flight muscles,NA,flight muscle,NA
Vairimorpha sp. 2,"Entomopathogenicity of Vairimorpha sp. (Microsporidia) in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae). The biocontrol potential of a microsporidian pathogen, Vairimorpha sp., obtained from field collected diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella Linnaeus, was assessed in a laboratory colony of this insect. The pathogenicity was quantified using a standard bioassay procedure by infecting second instar larvae per os with variable dose levels of the pathogen. Vairimorpha sp. caused 100% mortality even at a dosage of 1.5 x 103 spores per larva. The median lethal dose (LD50) was 2.2 x 104 spores per larva on day 5 post-inoculation. The time taken to achieve 90-100% mortality was dose dependent and varied from 5 days with 1.5 x 106 spores per larva to 11 days with 1.5 x 103 spores per larva. The pathogen reduced the food consumption of P. xylostella larvae by 75%, 93% and 95% at doses 1.5 x 104, 1.5 x 105 and 1.5 x 106 spores per larva, respectively. Histological observations showed that the pathogen preferentially infected adipose tissue cells but spread to almost all tissues. The pathogen was transmitted transovarially as well as horizontally and had a marked influence on progeny performance. It was concluded that Vairimorpha sp. has sufficient potential to be tested in the field as a biocontrol agent for P.

Vavraia anostraca,"Microsporidiosis on Artemia (Crustacea, Anostraca): light and electron microscopy of Vavraia anostraca sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Pleistophoridae) in the Brazilian solar salterns. A high prevalence of microsporidiosis was detected in an extensive culture of Artemia in two Brazilian solar salterns. The disease was responsible for the disruption of both the eggs and the biomass production. The main microsporidian is primarily a muscular parasite, with pansporoblastic development. All stages presented isolated nuclei. In merogonial stages, the amorphous coat divided with the cell, whereas in the sporogonial plasmodia the protoplasm retracted away from the coat, producing the vesicule cavity. Sporogonial division occurred both stepwise and by rosette-shape fragmentation. The number of nuclei in mature sporonts was variable and sometimes exceeded 64. As the sporophorous vesicle became mature, the matrix was occupied by metabolic granular products that became tubular. Microspores (3.3 × 2.1 μm) and macrospores (4.1 × 2.7 μm) were observed. The number of coils of the anisofilar filament was 11 (microspores) and 15 (macrospores). The ultrastructure and cytology of the parasite revealed that it was a new species: Vavraia anostraca sp. nov. For the first time a species of Vavraia is described in crustaceans.

Infected specimens were found in autumn in less than 1% of the population. Microsporidian parasites seem to develop in the connective tissue and fat cells. Numerous sporoblasts are formed by means of rosette-like budding of multinuclear sporont's plasmodium. The sporont's membrane is retained and it plays a pansporoblastic envelope role. The spores are oval-elongated, in freshwater smears measuring 3.4 (3.3-3.5) X 1.7 (1.6-1.8) μ. Exospore is two-layered, endospore is well developed. The anchoring disc has a typical form, the polaroblast is lamellary, occupying V4—V3 of the spore's volume. The polar filament is anisofilar and appears as 2—3 coils of the thick part, one intermediate coil and 4-6 coils of the thin part in a single layer. The spore is uninuclear.

Two novel microsporidia infecting the fat body tissues in larvae of two hosts, Halesus digitatus and Micropterna sequax (Trichoptera, Limnephilidae), were investigated using light and electron microscopy and rDNA sequence analyses. The molecular and morphological characters of these isolates warrant creation of a new microsporidian genus, Zelenkaia gen. n., with two species, one named herein. Developmental stages of Zelenkaia spp. have single nuclei. In sporogony, a plasmodium with four nuclei gives rise by rosette-like budding to two pairs of uninucleate sporoblasts, each within a thin-walled, subpersistent sporophorous vesicle. Sporoblasts and mature spores adhere temporary together, forming doublets oriented in parallel, within the sporophorous vesicle. Spores are long-oval and uninucleate, and those of the type species Z. trichopterae measure 10.3×3.5μm and have 24–25 polar filament coils.

Amblyospora connecticus (1),"Amblyospora connecticus sp. nov. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae): Horizontal transmission studies in the mosquito Aedes cantator and formal description. The morphology, development, and ultrastructure of an Amblyospora (Microsporida) species parasitic in the salt marsh mosquito, Aedes cantator, were investigated following horizontal transmission of infection from the intermediate copepod host, Acanthocyclops vernalis. Infections were readily transmitted to A. cantator in the laboratory when larvae were allowed to feed on spores harvested from A. vernalis. The microsporidium was observed to initially invade the midgut and gastric caeca of host larvae and then spread to the muscles, oenocytes, and Malpighian tubules. It divides by binary fission within these host tissues and produces uninucleated gametes that undergo plasmogamy to form diplokaryotic stages in adult hosts. Diplokaryotic sporonts sporulate in adult female hosts only when a blood meal is taken and this results in the formation of binucleated spores that are responsible for transovarial transmission to the next host mosquito generation. Quantitative studies show that male mosquito hosts are more susceptible and develop more progressive infections than females. However, the microsporidium never sporulates in males and the fate and function of these infections in male hosts remain unknown.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations.

Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of caddis flies and the generic position is discussed. It is obviously identical to the microsporidium Mackinnon (1911) reported under the name Gurleya legeri Hesse, 1903.",Gurleya dorisae,Anabolin nervosa; Micropterna lateralis,adipose tissue,NA,NA,NA,adipose tissue (Anabolin nervosa),NA
Loma morhua (1),"Electron Microscopical Study of a New Genus and New Species of Microsporida in the Gills of Atlantic Cod Gadus Morhua L.*. A microsporidium, forming xenoparasitie complexes (xencmas) of the cell-hypertrophy tumour type, was found in the gills of the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. and studied with the electron microscope. It seemed to be similar to Nosema branehiale Nemeezek, 1911, in the haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus (L.) except in size of spore. The xenoma (cyst) was basically like the Glugea eyst and the parasite had some other characters in common with Glugea; it was apansporoblastie, unikaryotic, disporoblastie and underwent partial development in parasitophorous vacuoles. It differed from Glugea in lacking plasmodial stages, producing usually 1 or 2 spores (rather than 16) in a vacuole, showing no distinct tendency for different stages to occur in different zones of the cyst and having tubules in the parasitophorous vacuoles. The name Loma morhua n. g., n. sp. (type) was proposed and the genus assigned to the family Glugeidae Thelohan. 1892.

Myosporidium spraguei,"Two Novel Microsporidia in Skeletal Muscle of Pike-Perch Sander lucioperca and Burbot Lota lota in Finland. Two new species of Microsporidia were recognized in skeletal muscle of freshwater fishes from Finland. Myosporidium spraguei n. sp. from pike-perch Sander lucioperca occurred as mature spores within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) within a xenoma. The ovoid spores were 3.8 μm long and 2.4 μm wide, based on transmission electron micrographs (TEM). The exospore and endospore were equally thick, the nucleus was monokaryotic and the polar filament was isofilar with 12 coils in a single rank, entirely adjacent to the prominent posterior vacuole. Small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequence confirmed the presence of M. spraguei n. sp. in burbot Lota lota . The second species, Microsporidium luciopercae n. sp., also from pike-perch, occurred within SPVs that occupied only a fraction of the volume of the otherwise intact myocyte; no xenoma was produced. Myocyte degeneration and necrosis occurred as mature spores dispersed into direct contact with the sarcoplasm. The ovoid spores were 4.6 μm long and 2.8 μm wide (based on TEM); they were monokaryotic and the polar filament was isofilar with 25 coils in a single rank in the posterior of the spore. The exospore was relatively thin with an irregular profile. Neither infection elicited an inflammatory response, although degenerate spores were observed within host cells, suggesting phagocytosis. Phylogenetic analysis of SSU sequences placed both organisms on distinct clades within the Marinosporidia.",Myosporidium spraguei,Sander lucioperca; Lota lota,NA,NA,NA,NA,"skeletal muscle (Sander lucioperca, Lota lota)",NA
Nosema liturae,"Nosema liturae sp. n., a new species of microsporidia from the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera litura. Nosema liturae sp. n. was isolated from larvae of Spodoptera litura in Guangzhou. It easily transmitted to Heliothis armigera. In the two lepidopterous, the microsporidian caused n general infection and was highly pathogenic. Also, experimental infection was found in eight, addition lepidopterous host; but Bombyx mori, Lymantria dispar, Clostera anachoreta and Plutella maculipennis were refractory to the infection. The fresh spores were typically long ovoid in shape, with a mean size of 4.34±0.27×1.99±0.14μm. The mean polar filament length was 94.2±11.97μm. Ultrastruetural studies showed that the filament was normally arranged in 12—13 coils at an angle of 78—82° to the axie of spores.

Nosema sp. 31,"Dimorphism of spores of Nosema spp. in cultured cell. A Nosema sp. from the lawn grass cutworm, Spodoptera depravata, produced two types of spores in cultured cells of Antheraea eucalypti. One was characterized by 3 to 5 coils of the polar tube, thin endospore (35 nm), early development (36 hr postinoculation), and the spontaneous discharge of a short polar tube. The other type characterized by 10 to 12 coils of the polar tube, thick endospore (91 nm), and late development (54 hr postinoculation) was the predominant spore in later culture and was similar to the purified spores harvested from diseased insects, which discharged a long polar tube.

Nosema sp. 36,"Spore Dimorphism and Some Other Biological Features of a Nosema sp. Isolated from the Lawn Grass Cutworm, Spodoptera depravata Butler. A microsporidian isolated from the lawn grass cutworm, Spodoptera depravata Butler had two nuclei in diplokaryotic arrangement throughout its development. A sporont gave rise to two spores, and there was no sporophorous vesicle. This microsporidium produced two types of spores, those with 2 to 3 coils and those with 11 to 12 coils of the polar tube during development in Antheraea eucalypti cells. Larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, were not infected by the microsporidium when the spores were administered perorally. Spores of the predominant type, with 11 to 12 polar tube coils, were longer and narrower than those of the corresponding spores of Nosema bombycis. Furthermore they did not react with latex particles, which had been sensitized with a monoclonal antibody against spores of N. bombycis, another isolate of Nosema (M11) or an isolate of Vairimorpha (M12).

Nosema sp. CmM2,"Identification of a microsporidian isolate from Cnaphalocrocis Medinalis and its pathogenicity to Bombyx mori. A microsporidian, CmM2, was isolated from Cnaphalocrocis medinalis. The biological characters, molecular analysis and pathogenicity of CmM2 were studied. The spore of CmM2 is long oval in shape and 3.45 ± 0.25 × 1.68 ± 0.18 µm in size, the life cycle includes meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts, and spores, with typical diplokaryon in each stage, propagated in binary fission. There is positive coagulation reaction between CmM2 and the polyclonal antibody of Nosema bombycis (N.b.). CmM2 spores is binuclear, and has 10–12 polar filament coils. The small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequence of CmM2 was obtained by PCR amplification and sequencing, the phylogenetic tree based on SSU rRNA sequences had been constructed, and the similarity and genetic distance of SSU rRNA sequences were analyzed, showed that CmM2 was grouped in the Nosema clade. The 50% infectious concentration of CmM2 to Bombyx mori is 4.72 × 104 spores ml−1, and the germinative infection rate is 12.33%. The results showed that CmM2 is classified into genus Nosema, as Nosema sp. CmM2, and has a heavy infectivity to B. mori.

Nosema sp. CS,"Morphological and phylogenetic analysis of a microsporidium (Nosema sp.) isolated from rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). A new microsporidium was isolated from Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), one of the most important rice pests in China. The morphology and molecular systematics of this novel microsporidium were described in this study. The spores were long oval and measured 3.17 × 1.64 μm on fresh smears. Ultrastructure of the spores was characteristic for the genus Nosema: a diplokaryon, 10–12 polar filament coils of the same type, and posterior vacuole. Small subunit rRNA gene sequence data and phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that the microsporidian species from C. suppressalis belong to the true Nosema sub-group of the genus Nosema. Besides, the microsporidium Nosema sp. CS could cause systemic infection of Bombyx mori and infect silkworms through vertical transmission. Therefore, mulberry field pest control should be carefully monitored, and sanitation of mulberry leaves is essential to control the pebrine disease in sericulture.",Nosema sp.

Trachipleistophora extenrec,"Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. a New Microsporidian (Fungi: Microsporidia) Infecting Mammals. ABSTRACT. A new microsporidian Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. was isolated from a muscle lesion of the streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus Cuvier, 1798 (Mammalia, Tenrecidae), an insectivore endemic to Madagascar. The spores isolated from the tenrec were infectious to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intramuscular injection. Material obtained from muscular lesions in mice was used for the parasite description. All developmental stages of the microsporidian were covered by a dense coat, which during sporogony changed into the sporophorous vesicle wall. Eight, 16, 32, or more spores were formed inside the sporophorous vesicle as the result of the division by plasmotomy and sequential fission of a multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium. Spores were ovoid, 4.7 × 2.8 μm in size, had a large posterior vacuole, and had an isofilar polar tube with 15–16 coils. Although the fine structure and the developmental pattern of the organism were in some respects similar to the genus Vavraia, molecular phylogeny based on the gene sequences of the small subunit rRNA and RNA polymerase subunit II indicated that the organism belongs to the genus Trachipleistophora. The diagnostic characters of the genera Trachipleistophora and Vavraia are discussed as well as the discrepancies between the phylogenies of these two microsporidian genera based on morphology and molecules.",Trachipleistophora extenrec,Hemicentetes semispinosus; mice,muscle,NA,NA,NA,muscle (Hemicentetes semispinosus),NA
Tuzetia weidneri (1),"Ultrastructure of Tuzetia weidneri sp. n. (Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae) in skeletal muscle of Litopenaeus setiferus and Farfantepenaeus aztecus (Crustacea: Decapoda) and new data on Perezia nelsoni (Microsporidia: Pereziidae) in L. Setiferus. A new microsporidian species, Tuzetia weidneri sp. n., is described from the skeletal muscle of the decapod crustaceans Litopenaeus setiferus and Farfantepenaeus aztecus. Fresh spores are pyriform, measuring 3.1 × 2.3 μm. All stages have unpaired nuclei. Meronts lie in direct contact with degenerate host cell cytoplasm but produce numerous small blisters at the surface. Multinucleate meronts divide by constriction into groups or chains of uninucleate products. Sporogony is initiated by deposition of a dense surface coat on the plasma membrane of uninucleate or multinucleate stages and fusion of blisters to enclose the sporont in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). Episporontal secretions in the SV are involved in the division of the sporont. During sporogonic division into chains of sporoblasts, the SV divides together with the body of the sporont, so that each sporoblast is enclosed in its own SV. Spores have a flattened anchoring disc that lies in the polar sac, membranous and spongiform regions of the polaroplast and 9-10.5 coils of the isofilar polar tube, around a posterior vacuole. The endospore layer of the spore wall is not thinned over the anchoring disc. The spore wall is adorned with a complex series of ridges. New data are presented on the spores of Perezia nelsoni (Sprague 1950) in L. setiferus. Of special interest is the polaroplast which is composed of an outer region of tightly-packed membranes in the form of a globule, which almost invariably completely encloses an inner region of loosely packed membranes. The isofilar polar tube, arranged in 8-10 coils angled around the large nucleus in the posterior half of the spore, passes through the membranes of the globular polaroplast near the periphery of the spore, then runs a curved course through the inner polaroplast and passes again through the globular polaroplast to join the anchoring disc. A polaroplast with one region completely enclosed by another has not been described previously.",Tuzetia weidneri,Litopenaeus setiferus; Farfantepenaeus aztecus,muscle,NA,NA,NA,"muscle (Litopenaeus setiferus, Farfantepenaeus aztecus)",NA
