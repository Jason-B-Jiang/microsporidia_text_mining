Alternosema bostrichidis,"Ultrastructure, molecular phylogeny, and prevalence rates of Alternosema bostrichidis gen. nov. sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Terresporidia), a parasite of Prostephanus truncatus and Dinoderus spp. (Coleoptera, Bostrichidae). A new species and a new genus of a microsporidium Alternosema bostrichidis isolated from an adult Prostephanus truncatus in Mexico and from three species of the genus Dinoderus in Nigeria are described. The microsporidium is monomorphic, monoxenic, and develops in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The infection first appears with thoracic muscles, followed by a generalized invasion of the host. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. Mature spores are ovoid. Unfixed spores measure 3.7–4.2 × 2.0–2.6 μm, fixed and stained spores 3.5–5.0 × 2.4–2.8 μm. The polaroplast consists of dense lamellae and rare lamellae. The polar tube is slightly anisofilar, consisting of 11–17 coils, with 9–14 proximal (130 nm in diameter) and 2–3 distal coils (120 nm in diameter) arranged in one layer. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based upon a short portion of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Genbank accession # KP455651) placed the new microsporidium within Liebermannia-Orthosomella lineage, which contains multiple undescribed parasites. In particular, A. bostrichidis showed maximal sequence similarity of 95% to Microsporidium sp. BBRE2 (# FJ755987) from Baikalian Diplacanthus brevispinus (Amphipoda: Acanthogammaridae) and Microsporidium sp. Comp CD Van 2 (# KC111784) from compost and soil in Canada. Frequent, devastating epizootics of laboratory cultures of A. bostrichidis support its potential as a biological control agent of grain borers.",Prostephanus truncatus; Dinoderus bifoveolatus; Dinoderus porcellus; Dinoderus minutus,muscles; gonads; midgut epithelium; Malpighian tubules (vessels); fat body,thoracic muscles (Prostephanus truncatus); thoracic muscles (Dinoderus spp.),Prostephanus truncatus; Dinoderus spp.,
Amblyospora abserrati,"Ultrastructural Characterization of Meiospores of Six New Species of Amblyospora (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) from Northern Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes. The ultrastructure of meiospores of six different species of Amblyospora found infecting larval mosquitoes of Aedes abserratus, Aedes aurifer, Aedes cinereus, Aedes excruciates, Aedes sticticus, and Aedes stimulans are described. Meiospores of all species exhibited characteristics typical for the genus Amblyospora including: a single nucleus, a large posterior vacuole, a thick undulating exospore and thinner endospore, a bipartite and lamellate polaroplast with more tightly stacked membranes in the proximal region, and an anisofilar polar filament with distal coils reduced in thickness. Distinct differences were found in the arrangement and number/ ratio of coils formed by the broad basal and narrow distal portions of the polar filament. These differences, when quantified and averaged, were unique from all other mosquito‐parasitic species that have been examined ultrastructurally. Information on parasite development, natural field prevalence and transmission to suspected intermediate copepod hosts is presented. The creation of six new species, Amblyospora abserrati, Amblyospora auriferi, Amblyospora cinerei, Amblyospora excrucii, Amblyospora stictici, and Amblyospora stimuli is proposed.

Amblyospora camposi,"Life cycle and description of Amblyospora camposi n. sp. (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae) in the mosquito Culex renatoi (Diptera, Culicidae) and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus (Copepoda, Cyclopidae). The life cycle of Amblyospora camposi n. sp. is described from the mosquito Culex renatoi and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus collected in the leaf axils of the plant Eryngium cabrerae in Argentina. Meiospores of A. camposi (5.8 x 4.1 μm) were infectious per os to female adults of the copepod P. f. fimbriatus. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei, with sporulation involving the formation of a sub-persistent, sporontogenic, interfacial envelope and the production of a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of P. f. fimbriatus, were large, pyriform, and measured 10.70 x 3.85 μm. When ingested they infected C. renatoi larvae to initiate a sequence that involves schizogony and gametogony and ends with plasmogamy and nuclear association to form diplokaryotic meronts. Oblong ovate binucleate spores (7.86 x 2.96 μm) are formed in the adult mosquito and are responsible for vertical transmission to the filial generation. This is the first report of an Amblyospora species from a mosquito that inhabits the small-water bodies held in parts of terresterial plants (phytotelmata).",Culex renatoi; Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus,ovaries (P. f.

Amblyospora salinarian,"Amblyospora salinarian. sp. (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae), Parasite of Culex salinarius (Diptera: Culicidae): Its Life Cycle Stages in an Intermediate Host. Horizontal transmission testing with an Amblyospora species from the mosquito Culex salinarius has documented the involvement of a copepod intermediate host. Meiospores (one type of uninucleate spore) of the Amblyospora sp. were infectious per os to female Macrocyclops albidus adults. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei (were haplophasic), starting with the sporoplasms from the meiospore, continuing as a succession of schizonts undergoing binary division and ending with sporulation, producing a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of M. albidus,were lanceolate, slightly curved and measured 13.23 × 3.85 μm. They infected C. salinarius larvae, both male and female, when ingested. In addition, cross-infectivity testing was conducted and demonstrated that while A. californica from C. tarsalis will infect C. salinarius,it does not complete its life cycle in this host. Based on these findings, we conclude that Amblyospora sp. from Culex salinariusis a distinct species and assign it the name Amblyospora salinarian.

Anncaliia meligethi,"Nosema meligethi I. & R. (Microsporida) in populations of meligethes spp. in Europe. Samples of rape blossom beetles, Meligethes spp., from 12 countries in Eastern and Western Europe were inspected for the occurrence of Nosema meligethi L & R. infection. From most countries about a dozen samples and a few hundred beetles were inspected. A total of 13 910 individual beetles were checked under a compound microscope, and of these, 561 were found to be infected (4.03%). Despite careful examination, infection was not detectable in samples from the UK (1039 beetles inspected), Germany (694), Sweden (489), or Switzerland (280). One infected beetle was found among 444 beetles inspected from Austria, and one from Denmark (1/85). In contrast, the parasite was found rather regularly in samples from Finland and from Eastern European countries. No obvious reason for this pattern of infection is known, but pesticide usage at or close to the sampling sites may play a role, because most samples from which Nosema was detected originated from areas where few pesticides are used. Spore size measurements were made from seven N. meligethi isolates, and they appeared relatively uniform.

Anostracospora rigaudi,"Cytological, molecular and life cycle characterization of Anostracospora rigaudi n. g., n. sp. and Enterocytospora artemiae n. g., n. sp., two new microsporidian parasites infecting gut tissues of the brine shrimp Artemia. SUMMARY Two new microsporidia, Anostracospora rigaudi n. g., n. sp., and Enterocytospora artemiae n. g., n. sp. infecting the intestinal epithelium of Artemia parthenogenetica Bowen and Sterling, 1978 and Artemia franciscana Kellogg, 1906 in southern France are described. Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations. Hence, this study illustrates the usefulness of molecular approaches to study prevalent, but cryptic, infections involving microsporidian parasites of gut tissues.",Artemia franciscana; Artemia parthenogenetica,intestinal epithelium (Artemia franciscana); intestinal epithelium (Artemia parthenogenetica); gut tissues (brine shrimp),intestinal epithelium (Artemia franciscana); intestinal epithelium (Artemia parthenogenetica); gut tissues (brine shrimp),Artemia franciscana; Artemia parthenogenetica; brine shrimp,
Antonospora psocopterae,"New microsporidia parasitizing bark lice (Insecta: Psocoptera). Abstract Two species of bark lice, Xanthocaecilius sommermanae Mockford and Polypsocus corruptus Hagen, collected in a canopy Malaise trap placed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park as part of a survey of the park’s fauna, were found to be infected with microsporidia. Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data. The finding that samples fixed and stored for months in propylene glycol (“antifreeze”) are good enough for DNA sequence analysis and can be used for morphological analyses (if no better fixation alternatives are available), is promising for future surveys for microsporidia.",Xanthocaecilius sommermanae; Polypsocus corruptus,Adipose,NA,Xanthocaecilius sommermanae; Polypsocus corruptus,

Desmozoon lepeophtherii,"A hyperparasitic microsporidian infecting the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis: an rDNA-based molecular phylogenetic study. The sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is an obligate ectoparasitic copepod that lives on the external surface of salmonid fish. It is the most common ectoparasite of marine cage-reared salmonids, causing major economic loss to the aquaculture industry. During a sea louse monitoring programme, samples of L. salmonis were found to harbour an unreported microsporidian parasite. The microsporidian was observed in pre-adult and adult stages of both male and female copepods, with a prevalence of up to 5%. Unfixed spores were slightly pyriform in shape measuring 2.34 μm by 1.83 μm (±0.01 μm) and were not observed to be enclosed by a sporophorous vesicle. The microsporidian infection was observed in all areas of the copepods’ body, xenoma-like cysts forming directly under the cuticle in the epidermal tissue layer. In the present study, rDNA (530f–580r) sequence data gathered from the unidentified microsporidian parasite isolated from infected sea lice were compared with equivalents available in the databases in an attempt to identify its systematic position. The microsporidian was found to group within the phylogenetic clade containing the family Enterocytozoonidae, being most similar to members of the intranuclear genus Nucleospora.

Dictyocoela diporeiae n. sp. is described from Diporeia spp. (Amphipoda, Gammaridea) collected from Lake Superior (USA), and its morphology and taxonomic affiliation are discussed. In hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of infected amphipods, the microsporidian was observed to infect muscle tissue surrounding the ovaries. Melanized hemocytic encapsulations were often observed in or near masses of microsporidians. The microsporidians appeared as spores measuring 1.99 ± 0.09 μm long by 1.19 ± 0.05 μm wide. Each spore contained eight coils of isofilar polar filaments that were arranged in single ranks. Polar filaments measured 71 ± 3 nm in diameter. A prominent lamellar polaroplast composed of ordered concentric membranes was found at the apical end of the spore surrounding the polar filament. A distinct posterior vacuole was observed at the distal end of the spore.

Dictyocoela roeselum,"Coexistence of three microsporidia parasites in populations of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeseli: evidence for vertical transmission and positive effect on reproduction. We investigated the prevalence, transmission mode and fitness effects of infections by obligatory intracellular, microsporidian parasites in the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeseli. We found three different microsporidia species in this host, all using transovarial (vertical) transmission. All three coexist at different prevalences in two host populations, but bi-infected individuals were rarely found, suggesting no (or very little) horizontal transmission. It is predicted that vertically-transmitted parasites may exhibit sex-specific virulence in their hosts, or they may have either positive or neutral effects on host fitness. All three species differed in their transmission efficiency and infection intensity and our data suggest that these microsporidia exert sex-specific virulence by feminising male hosts. The patterns of infection we found exhibit convergent evolution with those of another amphipod host, Gammarus duebeni. Interestingly, we found that infected females breed earlier in the reproductive season than uninfected females. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to report a positive effect of microsporidian infection on female host reproduction.",Gammarus roeseli; Gammarus balcanicus; Gammarus fossarum,egg; ovarian (1),transovarial,Gammarus roeseli,
Duboscqia dengihilli,"Life cycle of a new species of Duboscqia (Microsporida: Thelohaniidae) infecting the mosquito Anopheles hilli and an intermediate copepod host, Apocyclops dengizicus. A new species of Microsporida, Duboscqia dengihilli, was found infecting larvae of the mosquito Anopheles hilli in northern Queensland, Australia. Laboratory experiments showed that binucleate spores formed within infected female mosquitoes were responsible for transovarial transmission to the next generation. Sporogony within the larval fat body was initiated by two diplokarya, one at each end of the cell, which undergo meiosis within a single sporophorous vesicle to form 16 meiospores. These spores are responsible for horizontal transmission to the copepod Apocyclops dengizicus. The microsporidium is transmitted back to the mosquito host via uninucleate pyriform spores formed within the copepod host which are infectious to larvae of A. hilli. The meronts within larvae infected by horizontal transmission ultimately develop into the binucleate spores within adult females to complete the life cycle. Thus, the development of this microsporidium involves vertical transmission between successive mosquito generations and horizontal transmission between mosquitoes and copepods similar to the life cycles of Amblyospora and Parathelohania.",Anopheles hilli; Apocyclops dengizicus,fat body (of Anopheles hilli larva); oenocytes (of Anopheles hilli adult female),transovarial (Anopheles hilli),Anopheles hilli; Apocyclops dengizicus,

Clinically, the microsporidiosis was characterized by decreased appetite, diarrhea, and weight loss. Histopathological changes consisted of villous atrophy, blunting of mucosa and flattening of individual epithelial cells in the large intestine. The ultrastructure of microsporidian spores was consistent with an Encephalitozoon species.

Enterocytozoon salmonis,"Enterocytozoon salmonis n. sp.: an intranuclear microsporidium from salmonid fish.. The developmental stages of a recently described microsporidian from the nucleus of hematopoietic cells of salmonid fish were found to be unique among the Microsporida. All observed stages, including meronts, sporonts, and spores were in direct contact with the host cell nucleus (principally hematopoietic cells) of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). There is no parasitophorous vacuole and sporogony does not involve formation of a pansporoblastic membrane as with other members of the suborder Apansporoblastina. The extrusion apparatus differentiates prior to division of sporogonial plasmodia. The spores are ovoid (1 x 2 microns) and uninucleate, and possess a coiled polar tube with 8-12 turns. Developmental stages of the salmonid microsporidian are similar to those described for Enterocytozoon bieneusi as found in the intestinal mucosa of human AIDS patients. However, the intranuclear development, different cell types, and host infected clearly separate the salmonid and human parasites.

Three distinct microsporidia were identified from parasitic copepods in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a partial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequence identified a genetically distinct variety of Desmozoon lepeophtherii from Lepeophtheirus salmonis on cultured Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, and this was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis resolved the SSU rDNA sequence of the second organism in a unique lineage that was most similar to microsporidia from marine and brackish water crustaceans. The second occurred in L. salmonis on Atlantic, sockeye Oncorhynchus nerka, chum O. keta and coho O. kisutch salmon, in Lepeophtheirus cuneifer on Atlantic salmon, and in Lepeophtheirus parviventris on Irish Lord Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus.

Fusasporis stethaprioni,"Tetra disseminated microsporidiosis: a novel disease in ornamental fish caused by Fusasporis stethaprioni n. gen. n. sp.. A novel microsporidial disease was documented in two ornamental fish species, black tetra Gymnocorymbus ternetzi Boulenger 1895 and cardinal tetra Paracheirodon axelrodi Schultz 1956. The non-xenoma-forming microsporidium occurred diffusely in most internal organs and the gill, thus referring to the condition as tetra disseminated microsporidiosis (TDM). The occurrence of TDM in black tetra was associated with chronic mortality in a domestic farmed population, while the case in cardinal tetra occurred in moribund fish while in quarantine at a public aquarium. Histology showed that coelomic visceral organs were frequently necrotic and severely disrupted by extensive infiltrates of macrophages. Infected macrophages were presumed responsible for the dissemination of spores throughout the body. Ultrastructural characteristics of the parasite developmental cycle included uninucleate meronts directly in the host cell cytoplasm. Sporonts were bi-nucleated as a result of karyokinesis and a parasite-produced sporophorous vesicle (SPV) became apparent at this stage. Cytokinesis resulted in two spores forming within each SPV. Spores were uniform in size, measuring about 3.9 ± 0.33 long by 2.0 ± 0.2 μm wide. Ultrastructure demonstrated two spore types, one with 9-12 polar filament coils and a double-layered exospore and a second type with 4-7 polar filament coils and a homogenously electron-dense exospore, with differences perhaps related to parasite transmission mechanisms. The 16S rDNA sequences showed closest identity to the genus Glugea (≈ 92%), though the developmental cycle, specifically being a non-xenoma-forming species and having two spores forming within a SPV, did not fit within the genus.

In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm. Fresh spores of the parasite are elongate or ellipsoidal and are 5.1-6.2 x 2.0-2.5µ, the average of 200 spores being 5.8 x 2.1 Spores fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Heidenhein's iron hematoxylin are 3.S-4.8 x 1.5-2.0 µ the average of 50 spores being 4.0 X 1.8 µ. Everted filaments are 180 µ at maximum, being 100-150 µ in the majority. The processes of schizogony and sporogony of the parasite studied with artificially infected ayu are in substance the same as those reported by Weissenberg (1968) on Glugea anomala and by Sprague and Yernick (1968) on G. weissenbergu A very small xenoma of 4x8 µ with a single schizont and a single host cell nucleus was found in the lamina propria of the villi of the gut of an ayu killed 5 days after infection. Sporonts in smear preparations of parasite are 3 x 4 µ and each sporont produce two spores. Therefore the parasite is classified into the genus Glugea. Inoculation experiments have shown that Salmo gairdneri is susceptible to the parasite, but. Gasterosteus acelatus microcephalus is unsusceptible. Of about 15 species of Glugea in fish, G. hertwigi has spores similar in size to those of the present Glugea, But the former differs from the latter in the following points. The hosts of G. hertwigi are Osmerus mordax and O. eperlanus and it has been reported by Weissenberg (1968) that Gasterosteus aceleatus is susceptible to G. hertwigi, G. anomala and G. weissenhergi are distinguishable in having smaller spores, 3 x 1.5-2 µ, and larger spores, 6.0-7.0 X 2.5-3.6 µ, respectively, and in having different hosts, the sticklebacks. G, takedai which was found in the rainbow trout in Japan is distinguishable in having smaller spores, 2.8-4.9 x 1.7-2.3 µ, and in not causing hypertrophy of the infected host cells.",Plecoglossus altivelis; Salmo gairdneri,peritoneum; visceral cavity; ovary; testes; fat body; pyloric caeca; spleen; muscles; liver; heart; gills; iris,NA,,
Gurleya dorisae,"LIGHT-MICROSCOPIC AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL-STUDY OF GURLEYA-LEGERI-SENSU MACKINNON (1911) WITH ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW SPECIES GURLEYA-DORISAE SP-N (MICROSPORA, GURLEYIDAE). The microsporidium Gurleya dorisae sp. n., a parasite of caddis fly larvae of the species Anabolin nervosa and Micropterna lateralis, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of caddis flies and the generic position is discussed. It is obviously identical to the microsporidium Mackinnon (1911) reported under the name Gurleya legeri Hesse, 1903.",Anabolin nervosa; Micropterna lateralis,adipose tissue (of Anabolin nervosa),NA,,
Heterosporis sutherlandae,"Description of the Microsporidian Parasite, Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp., Infecting Fish in the Great Lakes Region, USA. Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease worldwide, impacting wild and farmed raised fishes in both marine and freshwater environments. A previously undescribed species (Heterosporis sp.), with widespread distribution in the Great Lakes region, was the subject of this study. Three angler-caught fish were submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from 2009–2010 with lesions caused by intracellular proliferation of parasitic spores, resulting in destruction and eventual widespread necrosis of the host skeletal muscles. Mature ovoid (5.8 x 3.5μm) spores of a microsporidian parasite, consistent with the genus Heterosporis, were observed by light and electron microscopy. Molecular identification was performed using primer walking to obtain a near-complete rRNA gene sequence (~3,600 bp). A unique species of Heterosporis was identified, demonstrating less than 96% sequence identity to other published Heterosporis sp. on the basis of partial rRNA gene sequence analysis. Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp. (formerly Heterosporis sp.) was identified in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), northern pike (Esox lucius) and walleye (Sander vitreus) from inland lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Previous research suggests this species may be even more widespread in the Great Lakes region and should be reexamined using molecular techniques to better understand the distribution of this novel species.",Perca flavescens; Esox lucius; Sander vitreus,Skeletal muscles; mesenteric tissues,NA,,
Intrapredatorus barri,"Development of a new microsporidian parasite, Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) from the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann (Diptera: Culicidae). A microsporidium infecting the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann, collected from Liu-Chiu Islet of Taiwan, was shown to be heterosporous. Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts. Although it was similar to species of Amblyospora in host/parasite relations, we would rather assign this parasite to a newly established genus, i.e. Intrapredatorus and the name Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. was given for this microsporidium. The characteristics of the new genus was discussed in this article. However, its transmission routes remained uncertain thus far.",Culex fuscanus; Culex halifaxi,fat body,NA,,
Johenrea locustae,"Johenrea locustae n.g., n.sp. (Microspora: Glugeidae): A Pathogen of Migratory Locusts (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Oedipodinae) from Madagascar. A new microsporidium was isolated from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria capito, collected in Madagascar. This new species was found to be haplokaryotic throughout development, produced polysporophorous vesicles of parasite origin, and there was conspicuous xenoma formation. The xenoma was a complex structure composed primarily of fat body cells. The wall of the xenoma was bound by a basement membrane beneath which was a region of collagen-like fibers. Multiplication of the parasite occurred by way of both a schizogonic phase and by a sporulation phase. Schizonts divided either directly or with the intervention of paucinucleate plasmodia into additional schizonts. At some point, plasmodia developed (with an increase in size and number of nuclei) into sporogonial plasmodia with typically 16 nuclei. Sporogonial plasmodia elaborated an interfacial envelope within which they underwent sporogony. Sporophorous vesicles normally contained 16 spores but also 8 and rarely 32 spores were formed. Spores were elongate ovoid (sometimes slightly curved) and measured 8.3 by 3.8 μm (fresh) and 6.9 by 4.2 μm (fixed). Based on the development of the microsporidium and the features of the xenoparasitic complex, a new species and genus Johenrea locustae n.g., n.sp. is proposed.",Locusta migratoria capito; Locusta migratoria migratorioides; Schistocerca gregaria,fat body; adipose tissue; hemocoel; body wall; digestive tract (primary infection site),NA,,

Loma embiotocia n. sp. is described from the gills of shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata) from waters off Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Highest prevalence at a site was 15% and greatest intensity was 583 xenomas per fish. Xenomas averaged 0.13 mm in diameter (0.06-0.16 mm) and contained ovoid spores 4.8 x 2.6 (4.0-5.0 x 2.0-3.0) µm. Sporogonic stages were dispersed throughout the xenomas. The xenoma wall was smooth lacking invaginations into the cytoplasm; sporoblasts were not highly vacuolated, and the sporophorous vesicle formed before sporogony. In addition to differences in host and geographic location the new species is distinguished from Loma salmonae, the only other species in the genus known from British Columbia, by its internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA sequence.",Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus kisutch; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Salvelinus fontinalis; Salmo trutta,gills; spleen; heart,NA,,
Lotmaria passim,"Characterization of Two Species of Trypanosomatidae from the Honey Bee Apis mellifera: Crithidia mellificae Langridge and McGhee, and Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp.. Trypanosomatids are increasingly recognized as prevalent in European honey bees (Apis mellifera) and by default are attributed to one recognized species, Crithidia mellificae Langridge and McGhee, 1967. We provide reference genetic and ultrastructural data for type isolates of C. mellificae (ATCC 30254 and 30862) in comparison with two recent isolates from A. mellifera (BRL and SF). Phylogenetics unambiguously identify strains BRL/SF as a novel taxonomic unit distinct from C. mellificae strains 30254/30862 and assign all four strains as lineages of a novel clade within the subfamily Leishmaniinae. In vivo analyses show strains BRL/SF preferably colonize the hindgut, lining the lumen as adherent spheroids in a manner identical to previous descriptions from C. mellificae. Microscopy images show motile forms of C. mellificae are distinct from strains BRL/SF. We propose the binomial Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp. for this previously undescribed taxon. Analyses of new and previously accessioned genetic data show C. mellificae is still extant in bee populations, however, L. passim n. gen., n. sp. is currently the predominant trypanosomatid in A. mellifera globally.

Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae,"New microsporidia parasitizing bark lice (Insecta: Psocoptera). Abstract Two species of bark lice, Xanthocaecilius sommermanae Mockford and Polypsocus corruptus Hagen, collected in a canopy Malaise trap placed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park as part of a survey of the park’s fauna, were found to be infected with microsporidia. Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data. The finding that samples fixed and stored for months in propylene glycol (“antifreeze”) are good enough for DNA sequence analysis and can be used for morphological analyses (if no better fixation alternatives are available), is promising for future surveys for microsporidia.",Xanthocaecilius sommermanae; Polypsocus corruptus,Muscles,NA,,

Nematocida ausubeli,"A Large Collection of Novel Nematode-Infecting Microsporidia and Their Diverse Interactions with Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Related Nematodes. Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",Caenorhabditis briggsae; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis remanei,intestinal cells,NA,,

Nematocida parisii,"Microsporidia are natural intracellular parasites of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For decades the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been an important model system for biology, but little is known about its natural ecology. Recently, C. elegans has become the focus of studies of innate immunity and several pathogens have been shown to cause lethal intestinal infections in C. elegans. However none of these pathogens has been shown to invade nematode intestinal cells, and no pathogen has been isolated from wild-caught C. elegans. Here we describe an intracellular pathogen isolated from wild-caught C. elegans that we show is a new species of microsporidia. Microsporidia comprise a large class of eukaryotic intracellular parasites that are medically and agriculturally important, but poorly understood. We show that microsporidian infection of the C. elegans intestine proceeds through distinct stages and is transmitted horizontally. Disruption of a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web correlates with the release of microsporidian spores from infected cells, and appears to be part of a novel mechanism by which intracellular pathogens exit from infected cells. Unlike in bacterial intestinal infections, the p38 MAPK and insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways do not appear to play substantial roles in resistance to microsporidian infection in C. elegans. We found microsporidia in multiple wild-caught isolates of Caenorhabditis nematodes from diverse geographic locations. These results indicate that microsporidia are common parasites of C. elegans in the wild. In addition, the interaction between C. elegans and its natural microsporidian parasites provides a system in which to dissect intracellular intestinal infection in vivo and insight into the diversity of pathogenic mechanisms used by intracellular microbes.",Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis briggsae,Intestine,NA,,

In the anterior part of the polaroplast there are closely packed approximately 11 nm thick lamellae. The lamellae of the posterior polaroplast are thicker and less regular. In the posterior part of the mature spore a well fixed posterior body interpreted as a posterosome was often observed.

Nosema furnacalis,"Identification and Isolation of Dimorphic Spores from Nosema furnacalis (Microspora: Nosematidae). Spore morphology of Nosema furnacalis and infectivity for a clone of the Helicoverpa zea cell line were examined by both light and electron microscopy. Dimorphic spores were found in cultured cells infected with N. furnacalis. One type having a few coils of the polar filament (FC spore) germinated spontaneously inside or outside the cell after formation. The other type had many coils of the polar filament (MC spore). The FC spores possessed four coils of the polar filament and MC spores had nine coils on the average. This spore dimorphism was demonstrated to be a characteristic not limited to N. bombycis . With continued passage, the proportion of FC spores in cultured cells sharply increased. Spores isolated after passage 85 to 90 were used to infect cultured cells without prior priming at an alkaline pH. In cultures inoculated at a rate of 10 spores/cell, the prevalence of infected cells was 45% 24 hr postinoculation and 98% by 96 hr postinoculation.",Ostrinia nubilalis; Helicoverpa zea,silk gland (of Ostrinia nubilalis),NA,,

Nosema maddoxi,"Nosema maddoxi sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Nosematidae), a Widespread Pathogen of the Green Stink Bug Chinavia hilaris (Say) and the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Halyomorpha halys (Stål). Abstract We describe a unique microsporidian species that infects the green stink bug, Chinavia hilaris; the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys; the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus; and the dusky stink bug, Euschistus tristigmus. All life stages are unikaryotic, but analysis of the consensus small subunit region of the ribosomal gene places this microsporidium in the genus Nosema, which historically has been characterized by diplokaryotic life stages. It is also characterized by having the reversed arrangement of the ribosomal gene (LSU –ITS‐ SSU) found in species within the “true Nosema” clade. This microsporidium is apparently Holarctic in distribution. It is present in H. halys both where it is native in Asia and where it is invasive in North America, as well as in samples of North American native C. hilaris collected prior to the introduction of H. halys from Asia. Prevalence in H. halys from mid‐Atlantic, North America in 2015–2016 ranged from 0.0% to 28.3%, while prevalence in C. hilaris collected in Illinois in 1970–1972 ranged from 14.3% to 58.8%.

Nosema pilicornis,"A microsporidium, Nosema pilicornis sp. n., of the purslane sawfly, Schizocerella pilicornis. A new microsporidian species, Nosema pilicornis, which infects the purslane sawfly, Schizocerella pilicornis, is described. This microsporidium infects most body tissues of the host. N. pilicornis was compared to other microsporidian species infecting Hymenoptera and to a group of similar microsporidia infecting Lepidoptera. N. pilicornis could be distinguished from all other microsporidian species on the basis of host range and ultrastructural characteristics of the spore.

Nosema sp. HR,"Morphological and phylogenetic analysis of Nosema sp. HR (Microsporidia, Nosematidae): a new microsporidian pathogen of Histia rhodope Cramer (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae). A new microsporidium was isolated from Histia rhodope Cramer (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae), a pest of Bischofia javanica BL. in China. The morphology and molecular systematic of this novel microsporidian isolate had been described in this study. The spores were long oval and measured 3.1 × 1.9 μm on fresh smears. Ultrastructure of the spores was characteristic for the genus Nosema: 14–15 polar filament coils, posterior vacuole, and a diplokaryon. The sequenced rRNA gene of this isolate is 4309 bp long. The organization of the rRNA gene is 5′-LSU rRNA-ITS-SSU rRNA-IGS-5S-3′, which is similar to that of other Nosema species (such as Nosema bombycis). Phylogenetic analysis based on LSU rRNA gene and SSU rRNA gene both revealed that this novel micorsporidian which isolated from H. rhodope had close relationship to the genus Nosema. Additionally, this isolate can also cause systemic infection of Bombyx mori. So, we should pay attention not only to N. bombycis, but also to other microsporidian (such as Nosema sp.

Oogranate pervascens,"A New Genus Of Microsporidian Parasite (Hepatosporidae; Micro-Sporidia) Found In The Oocytes Of Ribbon Worms From The North Pacific Genus Maculaura (Heteronemertea; Nemertea). An intracellular microsporidian parasite was first observed within oocytes of Maculaura alaskensis, a small pilidiophoran nemertean, commonly found on sandflats along the Pacific coast of North America. Infected oocytes have large vesicles containing dozens to hundreds of diplokaryotic, ellipsoid spores measuring 1.3 by 2.3 µm. A partial small subunit nuclear ribosomal 18S gene sequence isolated from the microsporidian does not match any known microsporidian sequences in the public databases. Phylogenetic analysis groups it with Hepatospora eriocheir in a sister clade to the Enterocytozoonidae. All the known life stages of this parasite are contained within a membranous envelope. This microsporidian was identified in M. alaskensis, Maculaura aquilonia, Maculaura oregonensis, and Maculaura cerebrosa in Coos Bay, Oregon, in M. alaskensis from Newport, Oregon, and in M. aquilonia collected in Juneau, Alaska.

Ovipleistophora diplostomuri,"Phylogeny and morphology of Ovipleistophora diplostomuri n. sp. (Microsporidia) with a unique dual-host tropism for bluegill sunfish and the digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum (Strigeatida). SUMMARY Microsporidia are diverse opportunistic parasites abundant in aquatic organisms with some species hyperparasitic in digenean parasites. In the current study, we describe a unique microsporidian parasite, Ovipleistophora diplostomuri n. sp. that has a tropism for both the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, and its digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum. Though the microsporidium first infects a fish, the subsequent infection causes hypertrophy of the metacercarial wall and degeneration of the P. minimum metacercariae within the fish tissue. Genetic analysis placed this species within Ovipleistophora and ultrastructural characteristics were consistent with the genus, including the presence of dimorphic spores within sporophorous vesicles. Meronts did not have a surface coat of dense material, which has been previously reported for the genus. This is the first Ovipleistophora species described that does not have a tropism for ovary. Genetics demonstrated that O. diplostomuri n. sp. groups closely within fish microsporidia and not other species known to be hyperparasitic in digeneans, suggesting that it evolved from fish-infecting microsporidians and developed a secondary tropism for a common and widespread digenean parasite. The high genetic identity to Ovipleistophora species demonstrates the close relationship of this unique microsporidian with other microsporidia that infect ovary.",Lepomis macrochirus; infected with Posthodiplostomum minimum; Procambarus bivittatus,Internal organs; most commonly in liver; but also in spleen; kidney; epicardium,NA,,
Paranucleospora theridion,"Paranucleospora theridion n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporidia, Enterocytozoonidae) with a Life Cycle in the Salmon Louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis, Copepoda) and Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). ABSTRACT . Paranucleospora theridion n. gen, n. sp., infecting both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and its copepod parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis is described. The microsporidian exhibits nuclei in diplokaryotic arrangement during all known life-cycle stages in salmon, but only in the merogonal stages and early sporogonal stage in salmon lice. All developmental stages of P. theridion are in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. In salmon, two developmental cycles were observed, producing spores in the cytoplasm of phagocytes or epidermal cells (Cycle-I) and in the nuclei of epidermal cells (Cycle-II), respectively. Cycle-I spores are small and thin walled with a short polar tube, and are believed to be autoinfective. The larger oval intranuclear Cycle-II spores have a thick endospore and a longer polar tube, and are probably responsible for transmission from salmon to L. salmonis. Parasite development in the salmon louse occurs in several different cell types that may be extremely hypertrophied due to P. theridion proliferation. Diplokaryotic merogony precedes monokaryotic sporogony. The rounded spores produced are comparable to the intranuclear spores in the salmon in most aspects, and likely transmit the infection to salmon. Phylogenetic analysis of P. theridion partial rDNA sequences place the parasite in a position between Nucleospora salmonis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based on characteristics of the morphology, unique development involving a vertebrate fish as well as a crustacean ectoparasite host, and the results of the phylogenetic analyses it is suggested that P. theridion should be given status as a new species in a new genus.",Salmo salar; Lepeophtheirus salmonis,epithelial cells; leukocytes (in Salmo salar); endothelial cells (in Salmo salar); connective (in Lepeophtheirus salmonis); haemocytes (in Lepeophtheirus salmonis),NA,,

Takaokaspora nipponicus,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a microsporidian parasite, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. from the invasive rock pool mosquito, Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus. Graphical abstract Highlights • A new genus and species of Microsporidia is described from mosquitoes. • The microsporidium is vertically and horizontally transmitted and exhibits dimorphic development. • Development in vertically-infected larvae is fatal and results in the formation of uninucleate conical spores. • Horizontal transmission occurs via oral ingestion of spores produced in vertically-infected larvae. • The SSU rDNA sequence of the microsporidium is unique from all other mosquito-parasitic species. Abstract A new genus and species of Microsporidia, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. is described from Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (Theobald) and Ochlerotatus hatorii (Yamada) based on light microscope and ultrastructural morphology, developmental features, transmission cycles and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). The microsporidium is both vertically and horizontally transmitted, exhibits dimorphic development alternating between diplokaryotic and monokaryotic stages and produces two morphologically distinct spores, one in larvae and another in adult females. Horizontal transmission of infection to larval mosquitoes occurs via direct oral ingestion of uninucleate spores that are produced in vertically-infected larval hosts. Development in horizontally-infected hosts is diplokaryotic following karyokinesis of uninucleate schizonts and binary fission to produce small (4.3μm×2.0μm) membrane free, ovoid, binucleate spores that are confined to adult female reproductive tissues (ovariole sheath and oviducts). Vertical transmission of the microsporidium from adult females to larval progeny takes place via surface contamination of the egg (transovum). Microsporidian development in vertically-infected larvae is haplophasic with unpaired nuclei throughout, producing rosette-shaped sporogonial plasmodia contained within a thin non-persistent sporophorous vesicle and culminating in the formation of membrane free, uninucleate, conical spores (7.0μm×2.8μm). Development is confined to host fat body tissue which appears as swollen white masses in the thorax and selected segments of the abdomen causing larvae to appear abnormally distorted and results in death during the third and fourth instar stages. The SSU rDNA sequences obtained from the two morphologically identical microsporidia isolated from Oc. j. japonicus and Oc. hatorii were nearly identical and unique when compared with GenBank entries of all other mosquito-parasitic species. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and bootstrap analyses using the Neighbor Joining search parameter yielded similar typologies. In each case, the novel microsporidium was the sister group to the clade containing Parathelohania species from Anopheles mosquitoes and the monotypic Novothelohania ovalae from Ochlerotatus caspius showing approximately 10–13% sequence divergence to those two genera providing strong support for establishment as a separate genus.",Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus; Ochlerotatus hatorii,adipose of larvae (vertical trans.); gonads (of horizontally-infected adult female hosts),NA,,

Tetramicra brevifilum, a microsporidian parasite of Scophthalmus maximus, was found in Lophius budegassa for the first time. This parasite was detected in 5 of 199 hosts captured in the coastal waters of Barcelona (Northwest Mediterranean), which enlarges the geographic distribution of this microsporidian. Affected fish did not show any external sign of disease, and cysts of T. brevifilum were found associated with the body musculature but were easily differentiated from those of Spraguea lophii, another microsporidian present in this host.

Trachipleistophora extenrec,"Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. a New Microsporidian (Fungi: Microsporidia) Infecting Mammals. ABSTRACT. A new microsporidian Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. was isolated from a muscle lesion of the streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus Cuvier, 1798 (Mammalia, Tenrecidae), an insectivore endemic to Madagascar. The spores isolated from the tenrec were infectious to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intramuscular injection. Material obtained from muscular lesions in mice was used for the parasite description. All developmental stages of the microsporidian were covered by a dense coat, which during sporogony changed into the sporophorous vesicle wall. Eight, 16, 32, or more spores were formed inside the sporophorous vesicle as the result of the division by plasmotomy and sequential fission of a multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium. Spores were ovoid, 4.7 × 2.8 μm in size, had a large posterior vacuole, and had an isofilar polar tube with 15–16 coils. Although the fine structure and the developmental pattern of the organism were in some respects similar to the genus Vavraia, molecular phylogeny based on the gene sequences of the small subunit rRNA and RNA polymerase subunit II indicated that the organism belongs to the genus Trachipleistophora. The diagnostic characters of the genera Trachipleistophora and Vavraia are discussed as well as the discrepancies between the phylogenies of these two microsporidian genera based on morphology and molecules.",Hemicentetes semispinosus; Mus musculus,muscle (1;2),NA,,
Tuzetia weidneri,"Ultrastructure of Tuzetia weidneri sp. n. (Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae) in skeletal muscle of Litopenaeus setiferus and Farfantepenaeus aztecus (Crustacea: Decapoda) and new data on Perezia nelsoni (Microsporidia: Pereziidae) in L. Setiferus. A new microsporidian species, Tuzetia weidneri sp. n., is described from the skeletal muscle of the decapod crustaceans Litopenaeus setiferus and Farfantepenaeus aztecus. Fresh spores are pyriform, measuring 3.1 × 2.3 μm. All stages have unpaired nuclei. Meronts lie in direct contact with degenerate host cell cytoplasm but produce numerous small blisters at the surface. Multinucleate meronts divide by constriction into groups or chains of uninucleate products. Sporogony is initiated by deposition of a dense surface coat on the plasma membrane of uninucleate or multinucleate stages and fusion of blisters to enclose the sporont in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). Episporontal secretions in the SV are involved in the division of the sporont. During sporogonic division into chains of sporoblasts, the SV divides together with the body of the sporont, so that each sporoblast is enclosed in its own SV. Spores have a flattened anchoring disc that lies in the polar sac, membranous and spongiform regions of the polaroplast and 9-10.5 coils of the isofilar polar tube, around a posterior vacuole. The endospore layer of the spore wall is not thinned over the anchoring disc. The spore wall is adorned with a complex series of ridges. New data are presented on the spores of Perezia nelsoni (Sprague 1950) in L. setiferus. Of special interest is the polaroplast which is composed of an outer region of tightly-packed membranes in the form of a globule, which almost invariably completely encloses an inner region of loosely packed membranes. The isofilar polar tube, arranged in 8-10 coils angled around the large nucleus in the posterior half of the spore, passes through the membranes of the globular polaroplast near the periphery of the spore, then runs a curved course through the inner polaroplast and passes again through the globular polaroplast to join the anchoring disc. A polaroplast with one region completely enclosed by another has not been described previously.",Litopenaeus setiferus; Farfantepenaeus azectus,muscle (1;2),NA,,
Unnamed Microsporidia sp. 3,"Microsporidians in penaeid shrimp along the west coast of Madagascar. Three species of penaeid shrimp, Fenneropenaeus indicus, Penaeus monodon and P. sernisulcatus, found in trawler catches off the west coast of Madagascar were infected with microsporidian parasites. The infections were evident as muscular lesions with a cottony appearance when abundant. Spore size (2.6 x 1.6 mum) and morphology (ovoid) for the parasites infecting both F indicus and P. sernisulcatus were not significantly different, suggesting that they might be the same microsporidian species. Spore size (1.4 x 1.1 mum) and morphology (sub-globose to ovoid) in P. monodon infections were significantly different from those in the other 2 shrimp species, suggesting that it was a different parasite. The presence of microsporidians in this biogeographical zone means that there is a potential risk of infections of cultured shrimp in farms situated in the vicinity. This must be assessed by increasing current knowledge of the parasites.",Fenneropenaeus indicus; Penaeus semisulcatus,muscle (1;2),NA,,
Unnamed Nosema sp. 506,"Pathogens Associated with Southwestern Corn Borers and Southern Corn Stalk Borers (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). A study was undertaken to isolate entomopathogens of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyer, and southern corn stalk borer, Diatraea crambidoides (Grote). Field- collected diapausing larvae of southwestern corn borer (three sites in Mississippi) and southern corn stalk borer (one site in North Carolina), and a laboratory strain of D. grandiosella in the diapause state were maintained in a simulated winter followed by a simulated spring environment. Few larvae (#6%) collected from any of the Þeld sites died in the winter environment, and most insect mortality (11Ð25%) occurred after transfer of the larvae to the simulated spring environment. Mortality during the simulated spring period differed among the collection sites, and the highest mortality was recorded for southwestern corn borers from Washington County (25%), followed by Marshall (16%) and Oktibbeha (11%) Counties. A high level of mortality was also observed in southern corn stalk borers during the simulated spring period (27%). No viruses were observed, but a number of bacteria, microsporidia, and fungi were isolated from both southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae. In most instances, numerous bacterial taxa were isolated from cadavers, but on some occasions a single taxon predominated. The most prevalent bacterial taxon from larval and pupal cadavers was Enterococcus faecalis (Andrewes & Horder) Schleifer & Kilpper-Balz, but Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula, and Serratia marcescens Bizio were frequently isolated as well. Few fungi (1Ð7%) were recovered from southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae. The most common entomopathogenic taxon isolated was Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin from southern corn stalk borer larvae. Microsporidia were not isolated from southern corn stalk borers. However, Nosema spp. were isolated from southwestern corn borer cadavers from Washington (15%), Marshall (1%), and Oktibbeha (3%) Counties in Mississippi. In addition, we observed parasitism of southern corn stalk borer larvae by Macrocentrus cingulum Reinhard (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). No parasitism of southwestern corn borers was observed. Isolates of Bacillus, Beauveria, Entercoccus, Nosema, Pseudomonas and Serratia were all pathogenic to southwestern corn borer larvae under controlled environmental conditions, and with the exception of B. bassiana, these are novel pathogens of Diatraea corn borers.",Diatraea grandiosella; Ostrinia nubilalis; Diatraea crambidoides,egg; ovarian,NA,,
Vairimorpha sp.,"Infection and development of vairimorpha sp. NIS M12(microsporida: Protozoa) in a lepidopteran cell line. Vairimorpha sp. NIS M12, a microsporidian parasite isolated from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, successfully infected the cell line of Spodoptera frugiperda SF21AE II. After priming with 0.1N KOH solution, the spores were mixed thoroughly with S. frugiperda cells suspended in Rinaldini's solution. Inoculated cells were cultured at 28°C in IPL-41 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At a ratio of 30 spores per cell, 9.1% of S. frugiperda cells were infected initially with sporoplasms 1hr postinoculation. About 65% of the infected cells harbored a single sporoplasm. The spread of infection and spore production of V. sp. NIS M12 in cell cultures were markedly different from those of Nosema bombycis, while the in vitro life cycles of the two parasites was similar. Short-coiled spores occurred 72hr postinoculation, and longcoiled mature spores were produced 10 days postinoculation. No formation of syncytia was observed in Vairimorpha infected cell cultures",Bombyx mori; Spodoptera frugiperda,fat body (primary infection site); silk glands; muscles,NA,,
Vavraia parastacida,"Description of Vavraia parastacida sp. nov. (Microspora: Pleistophoridae) from marron, Cherax tenuimanus (Smith), (Decapoda: Parastacidae).. A plcistophorid microsporidian is described from marron, Cherax tenuimanus (Smith). The parasite is polysporous, forming eight, 16, 32 or 64 ovoid spores in persistent, two‐layered mcrontogcnctic sporophorous vesicles. Nuclei remain isolated throughout merogony and sporogony. The sporophorous vesicle forms from the amorphous coat surrounding meronts, which thickens and condenses into two layers during sporogony. The parasite is placed in Vavraia Weiser, 1977, and named Vavraia parastacida sp.

Vittaforma corneae,"Isolation of a Microsporidian from a Human Patient. Several genera of microsporidia have been identified morphologically in human tissue but none has yet been propagated in vitro. These primitive, obligate intracellular parasitic protozoa are poorly understood pathogens of a wide variety of vertebrates and invertebrates. In humans they are especially important as opportunistic pathogens in AIDS patients. A microsporidian was recovered from a human patient and propagated in vitro. The organism has diplokarya, divides by binary fission, and often is found free in the host cell cytoplasm. The name Nosema corneum is suggested.",Homo sapiens; athymic mice,eye cornea (of homo sapiens); liver (of athymic mice),NA,,
