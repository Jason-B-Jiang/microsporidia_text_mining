"Light and electron microscope studies on three new species of microsporidia from saltmarsh mosquitoes in Australia. Descriptions are given of three microsporidians found parasitising larvae of culicine mosquitoes in south-east Queensland, Australia. Two, Duboscqia aediphaga n.sp. and Microsporidium lotaensis n.sp. were recovered from larvae of Aedes (Ochlerotatus) vigilax (Skuse), and a third, Amblyospora pinensis n.sp., from Culex sitiens Wiedemann. The three species were studied by light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We believe this to be the first detailed account of the ultrastructure of a species of Duboscqia Perez.",Duboscqia aediphaga,Aedes (Ochlerotatus) vigilax,NA,Aedes (Ochlerotatus) vigilax,NA,A.

"Parasites of the Asian Tiger Mosquito and Other Container-Inhabiting Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in Northcentral Florida. Seven microorganisms including 4 protozoans, 2 fungi, and a bacterium infected Aedes albopictus (Skuse) larvae collected from 12 counties in northcentral Florida. Ae. albopictus and 14 other species of mosquitoes were collected from tires, flower-holding vases in cemeteries, other types of artificial containers, and treeholes. Ascogregarina taiwanensis (Lien & Levine) was the most common parasite of Ae. albopictus throughout the year. The microsporidium Vavraia culicis (Weiser) infected Aedes aegypti (L.), Ae. albopictus, Aedes triseriatus (Say), and Orthopodomyia signifera (Coquillett). A vibrio bacterium and 2 fungi (Leptolegnia sp. and Smittium culisetae Lichtwardt), infected Ae. albopictus larvae but were observed infrequently A. taiwanensis, S. culisetae, and the vibrio bacterium previously have been reported from Ae, albopictus. This is the Ist report of the other 4 microorganisms parasitizing Ae. albopictus larvae.",Microsporidium 1,Aedes albopictus,Microsporidium 1,NA,Microsporidium 1,NA
