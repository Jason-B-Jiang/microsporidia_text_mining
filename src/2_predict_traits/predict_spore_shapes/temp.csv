"A Large Collection of Novel Nematode-Infecting Microsporidia and Their Diverse Interactions with Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Related Nematodes. Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",Enteropsectra breve; Enteropsectra longa; Nematocida ausubeli; Nematocida ciargi; Nematocida homosporus; Nematocida major; Nematocida minor; Pancytospora epiphaga; Pancytospora philotis,ovoid || long thin rod || ovoid || ovoid || ovoid || ovoid || ovoid || ovoid || long thin rod,"['ovoid', 'long thin rod', 'ovoid', 'ovoid', 'ovoid', 'ovoid', 'ovoid', 'ovoid', 'long thin rod']","{'long thin rod', 'ovoid'}",

"A New Microsporidium Berwaldia Singularis Gen. et Sp.Nov. from Daphnia Pulex and a Survey of Microsporidia Described from Cladocera. A new microsporidian parasite of a freshwater cladoceran from southern Sweden is described using light and electron microscopical methods. Development comprises 2 merogonial sequences, the first resulting in a cluster of 8 merozoites, the second in a chain of 4 merozoites. Each secondary merozoite develops into a sporont which divides into 2 sporoblasts, each of which develops into a spore. The spores are broadly oval and in fresh smears measure about 6 fim in length, with a single nucleus and a posterosome. The polar filament is about 40 fim long, of even thickness throughout, and appears as 15—18 coils in a single layer. The anchoring disc is small and the polaroplast is composed of 2 lamellar parts. Outside the plasma membrane of the sporont a 5-layered, electrondense substance is produced, which further differentiates into endo- and exospore, an electron-dense substance occurring patchily on the exospore and a pansporoblast membrane. During development the sporoblasts and the young spores are connected by a dense substance. Mature spores appear single or paired. The pansporoblast membrane is composed of 2 structurally different layers, namely a thin outer, single membrane and an inner layer composed of tubular structures. It is connected to the spore coat by patches of the dense substance.

Crayfish are a vital ecological asset in their native range but can be highly damaging as invasive species. Knowledge of their diseases, including high levels of research on Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague), show that disease plays a vital role during crayfish invasions. Microsporidian diseases in crayfish are less studied but are thought to have important links to crayfish health and invasion dynamics. In this study we provide a systematic description of a novel microsporidian parasite from the Floridian crayfish, Procambarus paeninsulanus, with additional genetic identification from related Microsporidia from Procambarus fallax, Cambarellus shufeldtii and Cambarellus blacki. This novel microsporidium from P. paeninsulanus is described in a new genus, Cambaraspora, and species, Cambaraspora floridanus, and represents a novel member of the Clade V Microsporidia within the Glugeidae. The parasite develops in the muscle tissue of P. paeninsulanus, within a sporophorous vesicle, and produces a spore with 19-21 turns of the polar filament measuring 6.136 ± 0.84 µm in length and 2.12 ± 0.23 µm in width. The muscle-infecting nature of the parasite suggests that it is horizontally transmitted. Genetic data for the 18S of the parasite from all hosts confirms its assignment to Clade V and reveal it to be a relative of multiple fish-infecting parasites. It shows closest genetic relationship to Glugea plecoglossi, but branches alongside multiple microsporidia from fish, crustaceans and eDNA isolates. The information presented here suggests that this novel parasite may have the potential to infect piscine hosts and is a likely mortality driver in the P. paeninsulanus population.

Abstract A new microsporidium was isolated from Ocinara lida Moore (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), a pest of Ficus microcarpa L. f. in Taiwan. The microsporidium produces systemic infections in O. lida larvae; the midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, and midgut muscle tissues were the target tissues for this isolate, and atrophied fat body tissues were found in heavily infected larvae.

Although neither bacteria nor viruses were detected in routine diagnostic tests, apparently degenerated microsporidian cells or spores were frequently observed in wet smears of the musculature from diseased prawns. Histological observations also revealed characteristics typical of microsporidian infection throughout the host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed multiple life stages of a microsporidian parasite within the cytoplasm of host muscle cells. In addition, partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was obtained by a nested PCR using microsporidian specific primers. A consensus sequence was then deposited in GenBank (accession no. KU307278) and subjected to a general BLASTn search that yielded hits only for microsporidian sequence records. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate was most similar to the fish microsporidian clade containing the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Teramicra. The highest sequence identity, 87%, was with Potaspora spp. Based on histological, ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic data, we erected a new species, Potaspora macrobrachium for the novel microsporidium. The description of microsporidium in this important commercial host was fundamental for future consideration of factors affecting stock health and sustainability.",Potaspora macrobrachium,oval,['oval'],{'oval'},
"A new microsporidium, Vairimorpha subcoccinellae n. sp. (Microsporidia: Burenellidae), isolated from Subcoccinella vigintiquatuorpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). A new microsporidium was isolated from Subcoccinella vigintiquatuorpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a pest of Galega officinalis L. in Turkey. Infection in larval and adult stages was systemic with mature spores produced in the midgut, gonads, Malpighian tubules and, most extensively, fat body tissues. The microsporidium was polymorphic with two sporulation sequences producing two types of spores, binucleate spores with 13–15 coils of the polar tube, and uninucleate spores with 7 coils of the polar tube that developed within a sporophorous vesicle (SPV) to form meiospores. The 16S small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene of the microsporidium was sequenced and compared with twenty-seven microsporidian sequences from GenBank. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rRNA sequence, this microsporidium is unique within the Vairimorpha group. Morphological and genetic characters indicate that the described microsporidium is dissimilar to all known Vairimorpha species, and so is named here as Vairimorpha subcoccinellae n. sp.",Vairimorpha subcoccinellae,ovocylindrical (1); ovoid (2),"['ovocylindrical', 'ovoid']","{'ovocylindrical', 'ovoid'}",

"Amazonspora hassar n. gen. and n. sp. (Phylum Microsporidia, fam. Glugeidae), a parasite of the Amazonian teleost Hassar orestis (fam. Doradidae). We describe the microsporidian Amazonspora hassar n. gen., n. sp. from the gill xenomas of the teleost Hassar orestis (Doradidae) collected in the estuarine region of the Amazon River. The parasite appeared as a small whitish xenoma located in the gill filaments near the blood vessels. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic host cell (HHC) in the cytoplasm of which the microsporidian developed and proliferated. The xenoma wall was composed of up to approximately 22 juxtaposed crossed layers of collagen fibers. The plasmalemma of the HHC presented numerous anastomosed, microvilli-like structures projecting outward through the 1-3 first internal layers of the collagen fibrils. The parasite was in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm in all stages of the cycle (merogony and sporogony). Sporogony appears to divide by plasmotomy, giving rise to 4 uninucleate sporoblasts, which develop into uninucleate spores. The ellipsoidal spores measured 2.69 ± 0.45 × 1.78 ± 0.18 μm, and the wall measured ∼75 nm. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, being shifted laterally from the anterior pole. The polar filament was arranged into 7-8 coils in a single layer in the posterior half of the spore, surrounding the posterior vacuole. The polaroplast surrounded the uncoiled portion of the polar filament, and it was exclusively lamellar. The spores and different life-cycle stages were intermingled within the cytoplasm of the HHC, surrounding the central hypertrophic deeply branched nucleus.

"Amblyospora connecticus sp. nov. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae): Horizontal transmission studies in the mosquito Aedes cantator and formal description. The morphology, development, and ultrastructure of an Amblyospora (Microsporida) species parasitic in the salt marsh mosquito, Aedes cantator, were investigated following horizontal transmission of infection from the intermediate copepod host, Acanthocyclops vernalis. Infections were readily transmitted to A. cantator in the laboratory when larvae were allowed to feed on spores harvested from A. vernalis. The microsporidium was observed to initially invade the midgut and gastric caeca of host larvae and then spread to the muscles, oenocytes, and Malpighian tubules. It divides by binary fission within these host tissues and produces uninucleated gametes that undergo plasmogamy to form diplokaryotic stages in adult hosts. Diplokaryotic sporonts sporulate in adult female hosts only when a blood meal is taken and this results in the formation of binucleated spores that are responsible for transovarial transmission to the next host mosquito generation. Quantitative studies show that male mosquito hosts are more susceptible and develop more progressive infections than females. However, the microsporidium never sporulates in males and the fate and function of these infections in male hosts remain unknown. A new species, Amblyospora connecticus, is proposed for this isolate and a formal taxonomic description is given based on its entire life cycle in both hosts.",Amblyospora connecticus (1),elongate,['elongate'],{'elongate'},

Horizontal transmission testing with an Amblyospora species from the mosquito Culex salinarius has documented the involvement of a copepod intermediate host. Meiospores (one type of uninucleate spore) of the Amblyospora sp. were infectious per os to female Macrocyclops albidus adults. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei (were haplophasic), starting with the sporoplasms from the meiospore, continuing as a succession of schizonts undergoing binary division and ending with sporulation, producing a second type of uninucleate spore.

"Cellular distribution of a feminizing microsporidian parasite: a strategy for transovarial transmission. The cellular distribution of a vertically transmitted, feminizing microsporidian was followed in its host Gammarus duebeni. In adult females the parasite was restricted to gonadal tissue, in particular primary and secondary follicle cells. Spores were diplokaryotic with a thin spore wall and a short polar filament, characteristics typical of 'early' spores involved in autoinfection. The diplokaryotic life-cycle, absence of spore groupings and of a pansporoblast membrane typify the genus Nosema. However, the unusual globular polaroplast of the spore and restriction of this stage to host ovarian tissue, have not previously been described in Nosema. Sporogony occurred only in follicle cells adjacent to developing oocytes and was in synchrony with the process of vitellogenesis. Oocytes were infected after formation of intracellular connections with follicle cells but harboured only vegetative stages of the parasite. Parasites were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm and, in developing embryos, segregated to daughter cells along the axis of the spindle. In juvenile animals there was no evidence of pathology linked with feminization and the parasite was found at low density in cells under the cuticle.

We describe the new microsporidium Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis gen. et sp. nov. with an emphasis on its ultrastructural characteristics and phylogenetic position as inferred from the sequence data of SSU rDNA, alpha- and beta-tubulin. This parasite was previously identified as Octosporea bayeri Jírovec, 1936 and has become a model system to study the ecology, epidemiology, evolution and genomics of microsporidia - host interactions. Here, we present evidence that shows its differences from O. bayeri. Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis exclusively infects the adipose tissue, the ovaries and the hypodermis of Daphnia magna and is found only in host populations located in coastal rock pool populations in Finland and Sweden. Merogonial stages of H. tvaerminnensis have isolated nuclei; merozoites are formed by binary fission or by the cleaving of a plasmodium with a small number of nuclei. A sporogonial plasmodium with isolated nuclei yields 8 sporoblasts. Elongated spores are generated by the most finger-like plasmodia. The mature spores are polymorphic in shape and size. Most spores are pyriform (4·9–5·6×2·2–2·3 μm) and have their polar filament arranged in 12–13 coils. A second, elongated spore type (6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm) is rod-shaped with blunt ends and measures 6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm. The envelope of the sporophorous vesicle is thin and fragile, formed at the beginning of the sporogony. Cytological and molecular comparisons with Flabelliforma magnivora, a parasite infecting the same tissues in the same host species, reveal that these two species are very closely related, yet distinct. Moreover, both cytological and molecular data indicate that these species are quite distant from F. montana, the type species of the genus Flabelliforma.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations.

ABSTRACT. Five new species of Loma were described from five Pacific fishes using light-microscopic and ultrastructural features along with phylogenetic analysis of the gene sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and elongation factor 1-alpha. Morphological data revealed both qualitative and quantitative differences in developmental stages and timing, vesicles, xenoma features, and spore sizes with statistical support that differentiated Loma pacificodae n. sp. in Pacific cod, Loma wallae n. sp. in walleye pollock, Loma kenti n. sp. in Pacific tomcod, Loma lingcodae n. sp. in lingcod, and Loma richardi n. sp. in sablefish from each other and other species in the genus. Phylogenetic analyses combined with monophyly tests supported species designations, but with low resolution in two cases perhaps due to rRNA paralogs or recent speciation. Loma branchialis in haddock was shown to be separate from Loma morhua in Atlantic cod, thereby making L. morhua, and not L. branchialis, the type species. A species from brook trout was shown to be a separate species from Loma salmonae, not a variant strain selected in the laboratory.

SUMMARY The present paper reports results of a transmission electron microscopy study of a new metchikovellid microsporidium. It was isolated from gregarines Polyrhabdina sp. inhabiting guts of polychaetes Pygospio elegans sampled at the White Sea silt littoral zone. Free sporogony (FS) occurred in the life cycle of the microsporidium alongside sac-bound sporogony (BS). Free spores resided in a parasitophorous vacuole and were of typical metchnikovellidean structure, uninucleate and oblong. They measured on sections 2·0–3·2×1·3–1·9 μm. The life cycle included pre-sporogonial stages represented by dikaryotic cells and 4-nucleate cells with coupled nuclei. A multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium of FS split in numerous (>10) sporoblasts. In BS segregation of sporoblasts occurred within thick-walled cysts by internal budding. Spore sacs of this microsporidium, measuring on average 11·6×4·7 μm, were limited by a thick electron-dense wall, externally ornamented with spirally wound cords of dense material. These oval spore sacs contained eight barrel-shaped spores, comparable in size and ultrastructure to FS spores. Ultrastructure of both types of spores and intracellular development of the new microsporidium and Metchnikovella spp. were similar, suggesting they belong to the same genus.

A microsporidian parasite, Nosema muscidifuracis n. sp., has been found in Muscidifurax raptor, a parasitoid of muscoid flies. Stages of the parasite developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm and were detected in midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ovaries (including oocytes) and fat body of larvae and adults. Spores were also detected within eggs deposited on the host. Light and electron microscopy revealed a developmental cycle with diplokaryotic stages dividing by binary fission and disporous sporulation sequences producing diplokaryotic spores of three morphological classes, differing significantly only in length of the polar filament. Two of the classes were found in larvae, pupae and adults. One of these, with about five turns in the coiled polar filament, is presumed to be responsible for transmission from cell to cell within the host (autoinfection) and the other, with about 10 turns, responsible for transmission from host to host. A third class, with about 15 turns in the polar filament, was found in eggs of M. raptor.

"Description of the Microsporidian Parasite, Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp., Infecting Fish in the Great Lakes Region, USA. Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease worldwide, impacting wild and farmed raised fishes in both marine and freshwater environments. A previously undescribed species (Heterosporis sp.), with widespread distribution in the Great Lakes region, was the subject of this study. Three angler-caught fish were submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from 2009–2010 with lesions caused by intracellular proliferation of parasitic spores, resulting in destruction and eventual widespread necrosis of the host skeletal muscles. Mature ovoid (5.8 x 3.5μm) spores of a microsporidian parasite, consistent with the genus Heterosporis, were observed by light and electron microscopy. Molecular identification was performed using primer walking to obtain a near-complete rRNA gene sequence (~3,600 bp). A unique species of Heterosporis was identified, demonstrating less than 96% sequence identity to other published Heterosporis sp. on the basis of partial rRNA gene sequence analysis. Heterosporis sutherlandae n. sp. (formerly Heterosporis sp.) was identified in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), northern pike (Esox lucius) and walleye (Sander vitreus) from inland lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Previous research suggests this species may be even more widespread in the Great Lakes region and should be reexamined using molecular techniques to better understand the distribution of this novel species.",Heterosporis sutherlandae,ovoid to pyriform,['ovoid to pyriform'],{'ovoid to pyriform'},ovoid
"Development and Molecular Characterisation of the Microsporidian Schroedera airthreyi n. sp. in a Freshwater Bryozoan Plumatella sp. (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata). Abstract. The development of a new species of microsporidian, infecting a freshwater Plumatellid bryozoan, is described. The small-subunit rDNA, internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and partial large-subunit rDNA genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the parasite clustered with Schroedera plumatellae. However, while there were morphological affinities with this species, significant differences were also observed. The infection initially appeared as a roughening of the peritoneum lining the metacoelom of the bryozoan. This roughening resolved into meront-infected syncytia, composed of interconnected cells of the body wall that detached to float in the coleomic cavity. Spores were observed to develop within these syncytia. All stages of development were diplokaryotic in contrast to S. plumatellae, which has a distinct monokaryotic merogony preceding sporogony. The infection was pathogenic to the host. Direct bryozoan–bryozoan transmission was not observed.

"Development and pathology of two undescribed species of microsporidia infecting the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henrio. Two undescribed species of microsporidia were found in mass-reared Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot from two commercial sources during a routine examination of these predators for pathogens. Both microsporidian species were described from specimens that had been prepared for transmission electron microscopy; live specimens were unavailable for examination. One microsporidium, identified as Species A, was described from two specimens obtained from a commercial insectary in North America. All observed stages of this microsporidium were uninucleate. Rounded-to-ovoid schizonts appeared to develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of lyrate organ cells (ovarian tissue). Mature spores of Species A were elongate-ovoid and measured 2.88 × 1.21 μm. A polar filament coiled 7 to 10 times in the posterior half of the spore. Sporoblasts and spores were observed in the cytoplasm of cells of numerous tissues and in developing eggs within gravid females. A second species, identified as Species B, was described from five specimens obtained from a commercial source in Israel. All observed stages of this microsporidium were uninucleate. Schizonts of Species B were observed within the cytoplasm of cecal wall cells and within the nuclei of lyrate organ cells. Mature spores were ovoid and measured 2.65 × 1.21 μm. A polar filament coiled 3 to 4 times in the posterior half of the spore. Densely packed ribosomes often concealed the polar filament and other internal spore characteristics. Spores were observed in the cytoplasm of cells of numerous tissues and occasionally within the nuclei of lyrate organ cells. Numerous spores and presporal stages were observed within the ovary and developing eggs. The development and pathology of Species A and B were compared to those of Microsporidium phytoseiuli Bjørnson, Steiner and Keddie, a microsporidium previously described from P. persimilis obtained from a commercial source in Europe. The occurrence of three species of microsporidia within P. persimilis from three sources raises questions regarding the origin of these pathogens. Because microsporidia may have profound impact on the performance of P. persimilis, consideration must be given to the identification and exclusion of microsporidia from field-collected specimens or from predators that may be shared among commercial sources.",Unnamed Microsporidia sp.

"Development of Nosema partelli, new species (Protozoa: Microsporida: Nosematidae) in the stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The development of a new species of Nosema (N. partelli sp. n.) from the spotted stem borer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), is described. The microsporidia infect eggs, all larval stages and moths of both sexes of the borer. Infection of the eggs implies that transovarial transmission occurs. Spores of constant size are produced, meronts are mainly binucleated but may contain up to eight nuclei. Presporoblastic meronts are single structures, there are no linear or colony formations. Individual diplokaryotic sporoblasts are chromophilic, and slight overstaining produces almost black spherical and oval structures. The diplokaryotic nucleus is characterized by an achromatic line less than 1 mu-m in width which divides it through its centre. This characteristic does not occur in other species of Nosema and is unique to N. partelli. It occurs through all developmental stages from the diplokaryotic sporoblast to the encysting spores. Sporogony is heralded by spindle-shaped diplokaryotic sporoblasts. Diplokaryotic sporonts decrease in size, their nuclei tend to become smaller and pyknotic, after which visible detail is lost following encystment.",Nosema partelli,ovoid (from figures),['ovoid'],{'ovoid'},

"Discovery of a Natural Microsporidian Pathogen with a Broad Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans. Microbial pathogens often establish infection within particular niches of their host for replication. Determining how infection occurs preferentially in specific host tissues is a key aspect of understanding host-microbe interactions. Here, we describe the discovery of a natural microsporidian parasite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host. Altogether, this system provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.",Nematocida displodere,oblong,['oblong'],{'oblong'},

Only 1 genus (Nucleospora) within 1 family (Enterocytozoonidae) of the Microsporidia contains species that are parasitic within the nuclei of their host cells; to date, all described intranuclear Nucleospora spp. parasitise fish. This study describes the first intranuclear microsporidian parasite of an invertebrate, the European edible crab Cancer pagurus L. (Decapoda: Cancridae). Infected crabs displayed no obvious external signs, and maximum apparent prevalence of infection within a monthly sample was 3.45 %. Infected hepatopancreatic tubules were characterised by varying numbers of hypertrophic and eosinophilic nuclei within epithelial cells. Parasite stages appeared as eosinophilic granular accumulations causing margination of host chromatin. In advanced cases, the tubule epithelia degenerated, with parasites and sloughed epithelial cells appearing in tubule lumens. All life stages of the parasite were observed within host nuclei. Uninucleate meronts were not detected, although binucleate stages were observed. Multinucleate Plasmodia (sporogonal Plasmodia) contained up to 22 nuclei in section, and late-stage Plasmodia contained multiple copies of apparatus resembling the polar filament and anchoring disk, apparently associated with individual plasmodial nuclei. As such, aggregation and early assembly of sporoblast components took place within the intact sporogonial Plasmodium, a feature unique to the Enterocytozoonidae. Liberation of sporoblasts from Plasmodia or the presence of liberated sporoblasts was not observed in this study. However, large numbers of maturing and mature spores (measuring 1.3 ± 0.02 x 0.7 ± 0.01 μm) were frequently observed in direct contact with the host nucleoplasm.

"Euplotespora binucleata n. gen., n. sp. (Protozoa: Microsporidia), a Parasite Infecting the Hypotrichous Ciliate Euplotes woodruffi, with Observations on Microsporidian Infections in Ciliophora. ABSTRACT. A new microsporidian species, Euplotespora binucleata n. gen., n. sp., from the brackish-water ciliate Euplotes woodruffi is described and defined on the basis of life history characteristics, light and electron microscopic features, and small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. The life cycle of E. binucleata n. sp. probably has rather short merogonic and relatively long sporogonic phases. Some uninuclear meronts and sporonts, along with diplokaryotic sporoblasts and spores, were found in experimentally infected host cells. Such a peculiar life cycle has been induced experimentally in Euplotes eurystomus and constitutively microsporidian-free stocks of E. woodruffi. Spores of E. binucleata n. sp. are monomorphic, ovoid–cylindrical in shape, 3.44±0.17 × 1.65±0.22 μm in size, and characterized by a diplokaryotic condition and a large posterior vacuole. The polar tube is isofilar, 4.5–5.5 μm in length when ejected, and lacking a distinctive coiled region (half-coiled). The polaroplast is divided into two regions: the anterior part has a few lamellae close to the anchoring disc; and the posterior part is a rounded body (sack), about one-quarter of the spore length. Spores do not appear to cluster together as a group. Each spore is surrounded by a sporophorous membrane closely adjacent to the exospore layer. A phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA sequences by different methods placed E. binucleata n. sp. in a clade with representatives of the microsporidian genera Cystosporogenes and Vittaforma.

For the first time, a microsporidian infection was observed in the pest species Hellula undalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija, Philippines. Because H. undalis is difficult to control by chemical insecticides and microbiological control techniques have not been established, we investigated the biology, the pathogenicity and transmission of this pathogen found in H. undalis. An average of 16% of larvae obtained from crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija displayed microsporidian infections and 75% of infected H. undalis died during larval development. Histopathological studies revealed that the infection is initiated in the midgut and then spreads to all organs. The microsporidium has two different sporulation sequences: a disporoblastic development producing binucleate free mature spores and an octosporoblastic development forming eight uninucleate spores.

During a survey of the microsporean fauna of the two-spot red snapper Lutjanus bohar Forsskål, 1775, from the Red Sea off Jizan (Saudi Arabia), a species of Glugea Thélohan, 1891 was found that did not conform to any known species. The species is characterized by the presence of spherical xenomas (ca. 2-5 mm in diameter) in the host body cavity. Examination of the lifecycle stages and mature spores using light and transmission electron microscopy also revealed morphological characteristics typical of species of the genus Glugea. Spores were elongated-ovoid with a posterior vacuole surrounded by the polar filament coils. Mature spores were 4.5 (4.0-4.8) µm long and 2.5 (2.0-2.5) µm wide.

Microgemma hepaticus gen.nov. sp.nov. is described from the liver of juvenile grey mullet, Chelon labrosus (Risso). Development occurs within xenomas (diameter 500μm) which have microvillar surfaces, encircling bands of mitochondria and a reticulate hypertrophic nucleus. Vegetative developmental stages, meronts, are plasmodial and divided by plasmotomy. These stages are enclosed by host membranes. Sporogonic stages are free in the cytoplasm and divide by multiple exogenous budding. Uninucleate spores (2·4μm × 4·2μm) possess 7–9 coils of the polar filament and a lamellar polaroplast. Xenomas are associated with liver connective tissue, and cause necrosis of adjacent liver cells in certain circumstances. Host response to infection involves leucocyte infiltration and granuloma formation, with spores being destroyed by repeated macrophage phagocytosis and necrosis and resulting in gradual resolution of the lesion. Although juveniles apparently tolerate large parasite burdens there is some evidence of a contribution by the parasite to stress‐related mortality.

"Hyperspora aquatica n.gn., n.sp. (Microsporidia), hyperparasitic in Marteilia cochillia (Paramyxida), is closely related to crustacean-infecting microspordian taxa. SUMMARY The Paramyxida, closely related to haplosporidians, paradinids, and mikrocytids, is an obscure order of parasitic protists within the class Ascetosporea. All characterized ascetosporeans are parasites of invertebrate hosts, including molluscs, crustaceans and polychaetes. Representatives of the genus Marteilia are the best studied paramyxids, largely due to their impact on cultured oyster stocks, and their listing in international legislative frameworks. Although several examples of microsporidian hyperparasitism of paramyxids have been reported, phylogenetic data for these taxa are lacking. Recently, a microsporidian parasite was described infecting the paramyxid Marteilia cochillia, a serious pathogen of European cockles. In the current study, we investigated the phylogeny of the microsporidian hyperparasite infecting M. cochillia in cockles and, a further hyperparasite, Unikaryon legeri infecting the digenean Meiogymnophallus minutus, also in cockles. We show that rather than representing basally branching taxa in the increasingly replete Cryptomycota/Rozellomycota outgroup (containing taxa such as Mitosporidium and Paramicrosoridium), these hyperparasites instead group with other known microsporidian parasites infecting aquatic crustaceans. In doing so, we erect a new genus and species (Hyperspora aquatica n. gn., n.sp.) to contain the hyperparasite of M. cochillia and clarify the phylogenetic position of U. legeri. We propose that in both cases, hyperparasitism may provide a strategy for the vectoring of microsporidians between hosts of different trophic status (e.g. molluscs to crustaceans) within aquatic systems. In particular, we propose that the paramyxid hyperparasite H. aquatica may eventually be detected as a parasite of marine crustaceans. The potential route of transmission of the microsporidian between the paramyxid (in its host cockle) to crustaceans, and, the ‘hitch-hiking’ strategy employed by H. aquatica is discussed.",Hyperspora aquatica,spherical to ellipsoidal,['spherical to ellipsoidal'],{'spherical to ellipsoidal'},
"Ichthyosporidium weissii n. sp. (Microsporidia) Infecting the Arrow Goby ( Clevelandia ios). Abstract Gonadal infections by a novel microsporidium were discovered in 34% (13/38) of arrow gobies, Clevelandia ios, sampled over a 3‐yr period from Morro Bay Marina in Morro Bay, California. Gonadal tumors had been reported in arrow gobies from this geographic area. The infected gonads, found primarily in females, typically appeared grossly as large, white‐gray firm and lobulated masses. Histological examination revealed large, multilobate xenomas within the ovaries and no evidence of neoplasia. Typical of the genus Ichthyosporidium, the large xenomas were filled with developmental stages and pleomorphic spores. Wet mount preparations showed two general spore types: microspores with mean length of 6.2 (7.0–4.9, SD = 0.6, N = 20) μm and mean width of 4.3 (5.3–2.9, SD = 0.8) μm; and less numerous macrospores with mean length of 8.5 (10.1–7.1, SD = 1.0, N = 10) μm and mean width of 5.5 (6.2–4.8, SD = 0.5) μm.

Fifty percent of females from this population tested positive for vertically transmitted microsporidia. The PCR screen was 100% efficient in comparison with existing LM based screening. In addition, the PCR screen produced bands of 2 sizes suggesting that more than 1 species of microsporidian was present. Sequencing revealed 2 distinct species of vertically transmitted microsporidia; 33% of females were infected with the feminizer Nosema granulosis and 17% were infected with a new species which we provisionally designate Microsporidium sp.

The primary site of infection is the female gonad and the parasite is transovarially transmitted to the eggs. PCR screening reveals a female bias in the distribution of parasites (96.6% of females, N = 29; 22.2% of males, N = 27), which is indicative of host sex ratio distortion. The morphological and molecular characterisations of this new microsporidium place it outside all currently established genera.

While F. crangonycis is morphologically identical to uncharacterised microsporidia from populations of North American amphipods, it is distinct from microsporidia found in European populations of amphipods. These data support the hypothesis that vertically transmitted parasites may be selectively retained during invasion events.

This new species was found to be haplokaryotic throughout development, produced polysporophorous vesicles of parasite origin, and there was conspicuous xenoma formation. The xenoma was a complex structure composed primarily of fat body cells. The wall of the xenoma was bound by a basement membrane beneath which was a region of collagen-like fibers. Multiplication of the parasite occurred by way of both a schizogonic phase and by a sporulation phase. Schizonts divided either directly or with the intervention of paucinucleate plasmodia into additional schizonts.

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia.

The microsporidium Trichotuzetia guttata gen. et sp. n., a parasite of the copepod Cyclops vicinus in the Czech Republic, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. In the merogonial reproduction multinucleate plasmodia divide by plasmotomy, yielding uninucleate merozoites. Sporonts develop into multinucleate plasmodia, which split in a rosette-like manner, initially into wide lobes with large nuclei, finally into narrow lobes with small nuclei. Sporoblasts are formed in individual sporophorous vesicles generated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Immature sporogonial stages are covered by fibrillar projections uniting the exospore with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Mature spores, which are pyriform with pointed anterior end, normally lack projections. Unfixed spores measure 4.6-5.7x2.7-3.3 urn. The exospore is four-layered. The anterior lamellae of the polaroplast are wide. The posterior ones (present in a short zone) are narrow close to the filament, wider at the periphery.

A microsporidian of the genus Loma was noted in the gills of rainbow trout Onco-rhynchus mykiss from a state hatchery (Buford Trout Hatchery) in Georgia. Mortalities of varying severity occur at this hatchery every fall, and the microsporidian was noted during an experiment from August 1991 to January 1992 to determine the effects of water source on disease. Infections first appeared to be systemic in the October sample; xenomas were observed in heart, spleen, and peripheral vessel walls. The presence of unidentified intracellular material preceded the appearance of xenomas in all tissues, but whether this material was associated with inflammation or represented immature stages of the parasite has yet to be determined. These structures were also noted in the intestine and liver, although xenomas were not noted in these organs. Mature xenomas did not elicit an inflammatory response but appeared to be short-lived. When the xenoma wall ruptured and released spores, an inflammatory response was again observed.

(Microsporidia, Tetramicridae), Infecting Liver and Skeletal Muscle of Sea Scorpions, Taurulus bubalis (Euphrasen 1786) (Osteichthyes, Cottidae), an Inshore, Littoral Fish. Abstract. The ultrastructure of a new microsporidian species Microgemma vivaresi n. sp. causing liver cell xenoma formation in sea scorpions, Taurulus bubalis, is described. Stages of merogony, sporogony, and sporogenesis are mixed in the central cytoplasm of developing xenomas. All stages have unpaired nuclei. Uninucleate and multinucleate meronts lie within vacuoles formed from host endoplasmic reticulum and divide by binary or multiple fission. Sporonts, no longer in vacuoles, deposit plaques of surface coat on the plasma membrane that cause the surface to pucker. Division occurs at the puckered stage into sporoblast mother cells, on which plaques join up to complete the surface coat. A final binary fission gives rise to sporoblasts. A dense globule, thought to be involved in polar tube synthesis, is gradually dispersed during spore maturation. Spores are broadly ovoid, have a large posterior vacuole, and measure 3.6 μm × 2.1 μm (fresh). The polar tube has a short wide anterior section that constricts abruptly, then runs posteriad to coil about eight times around the posterior vacuole with granular contents. The polaroplast has up to 40 membranes arranged in pairs mostly attached to the wide region of the polar tube and directed posteriorly around a cytoplasm of a coarsely granular appearance. The species is placed alongside the type species Microgemma hepaticusRalphs and Matthews 1986 within the family Tetramicridae, which is transferred from the class Dihaplophasea to the class Haplophasea, as there is no evidence for the occurrence of a diplokaryotic phase.",Microgemma vivaresi,broad oval,['broad oval'],{'broad oval'},ovoid

"Microsporidia are natural intracellular parasites of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For decades the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been an important model system for biology, but little is known about its natural ecology. Recently, C. elegans has become the focus of studies of innate immunity and several pathogens have been shown to cause lethal intestinal infections in C. elegans. However none of these pathogens has been shown to invade nematode intestinal cells, and no pathogen has been isolated from wild-caught C. elegans. Here we describe an intracellular pathogen isolated from wild-caught C. elegans that we show is a new species of microsporidia. Microsporidia comprise a large class of eukaryotic intracellular parasites that are medically and agriculturally important, but poorly understood. We show that microsporidian infection of the C. elegans intestine proceeds through distinct stages and is transmitted horizontally. Disruption of a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web correlates with the release of microsporidian spores from infected cells, and appears to be part of a novel mechanism by which intracellular pathogens exit from infected cells. Unlike in bacterial intestinal infections, the p38 MAPK and insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways do not appear to play substantial roles in resistance to microsporidian infection in C. elegans. We found microsporidia in multiple wild-caught isolates of Caenorhabditis nematodes from diverse geographic locations. These results indicate that microsporidia are common parasites of C. elegans in the wild. In addition, the interaction between C. elegans and its natural microsporidian parasites provides a system in which to dissect intracellular intestinal infection in vivo and insight into the diversity of pathogenic mechanisms used by intracellular microbes.",Nematocida parisii (1),Rod-shaped,['rod-shaped'],{'rod-shaped'},

"Microsporidia-like Parasites of Amoebae Belong to the Early Fungal Lineage Rozellomycota.

This group, comprising almost exclusively environmental clones, includes the endoparasitic chytrid Rozella as the unique known representative. Rozella emerged as the first fungal lineage in molecular phylogenies and as the sister group of the Microsporidia. Here we report rDNA molecular phylogenetic analyses of two endonuclear parasites of free-living naked amoebae having microsporidia-like ultrastructural features but belonging to the rozellids.

"Microsporidian Infection in a Free-Living Marine Nematode. Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites. Although nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse animal groups, the only confirmed report of microsporidian infection was that of the “nematode killer” (Nematocida parisii). N. parisii was isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis sp. and causes an acute and lethal intestinal infection in a lab strain of Caenorhabditis elegans. We set out to characterize a microsporidian infection in a wild nematode to determine whether the infection pattern of N. parisii in the lab is typical of microsporidian infections in nematodes.

S. perivermis is not closely related to N. parisii and differs strikingly in all aspects of infection. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the infection was localized in the hypodermal and muscle tissues only and did not involve the intestines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed infection in the muscle and hypodermis, and surprisingly, it also revealed that the parasite infects O. rectangula eggs, suggesting a vertical mode of transmission.

"Molecular characterization and taxonomy of a new species of Caudosporidae (Microsporidia) from black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae), with host-derived relationships of the North American caudosporids. A new species of microsporidium, Caudospora palustris (Microsporidia: Caudosporidae), is described from 3 species of black flies (Cnephia ornithophilia and diploid and triploid cytospecies of Stegopterna mutata), bringing to 7 the total species of caudosporids recorded from North America. This new species of caudosporid is recorded from swamp streams of the Coastal Plain from New Jersey to Georgia, with single records from the New Jersey mountains and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Densities of patently infected larvae (up to 10,600/m2) and spore production (nearly 8 x 1011/m2) are the greatest recorded for any microsporidium of black flies. The ultrastructure of this new species is presented, along with the first molecular characterization for a microsporidium of black flies. The phylogenetic position of black fly microsporidia within the phylum Microsporidia is presented; however, the analysis does not support the inclusion of C. palustris in any clade.

"Molecular identification of Nucleophaga terricolae sp. nov. (Rozellomycota), and new insights on the origin of the Microsporidia. Microsporidia are widespread endoparasites of animals, including humans. They are characterized by highly modified morphological and genetic features that cause difficulties in elucidating their enigmatic origin and evolution. Recent advances, however, indicate that the Microsporidia have emerged from the Rozellomycota, forming together either the most basal lineage of the Fungi or its closer relative. The Rozellomycota comprise a huge diversity of uncultured environmental clones, with a very few known species endoparasitic of algae and water moulds, like the chytrid-like Rozella, and of free-living amoebae, like Nucleophaga and the microsporidia-like Paramicrosporidium. A possible ancestral microsporidium, Mitosporidium, has recently been described from the water flea Daphnia, since the phylogenomic reconstruction showed that it branches to the root of the microsporidian tree, while the genome analysis revealed a fungal-like nuclear genome and the persistence of a mitochondrial genome. Here we report the 18S rDNA molecular phylogeny of an additional microsporidium-like endoparasite of amoebae, which has a developmental cycle almost identical to that of Nucleophaga amoebae. Our results show that the endoparasite is closely related to N. amoebae, forming a distinct species, for which we propose the name Nucleophaga terricolae. Furthermore, the Nucleophaga lineage is recovered as sister to the Microsporidia while Mitosporidium turns out to be member of a well-supported group of environmental clones. These results raise the question about the actual ancestry of the Microsporidia within the Rozellomycota. A precise and robust phylogeny will require further comparative genomic studies of these various strains, and should also consider the primitive microsporidia, for which genetic data are still lacking, because all these organisms are essentially morphologically similar.",Nucleophaga terricolae,spherical,['spherical'],{'spherical'},
"Morphologic and molecular data help adopting the insect-pathogenic nephridiophagids (Nephridiophagidae) among the early diverging fungal lineages, close to the Chytridiomycota. Nephridiophagids are poorly known unicellular eukaryotes, previously of uncertain systematic position, that parasitize the Malpighian tubules of insects. Their life cycle includes merogony with multinucleate plasmodia and sporogony leading to small, uninucleate spores. We examined the phylogenetic affiliations of three species of Nephridiophaga, including one new species, Nephridiophaga maderae, from the Madeira cockroach (Leucophaea maderae). In addition to the specific host, the new species differs from those already known by the size of the spores and by the number of spores within the sporogenic plasmodium. The inferred phylogenetic analyses strongly support a placement of the nephridiophagids in the fungal kingdom near its root and with a close, but unresolved, relationship to the chytids (Chytridiomycota).

"Morphological and genetical description of Loma psittaca sp. n. isolated from the Amazonian fish species Colomesus psittacus. A previously unrecognised fish-infecting microsporidia (Loma psittaca n. sp.), found adherent to the intestinal mucosa of the freshwater puffer fish Colomesus psittacus (Teleostei, Tetraodontidae) from lower Amazon River, was described based on light and transmission electron microscope and phylogenetic analysis. The whitish xenoma was completely filled by numerous spores, including several developmental stages of the parasite. In all of these stages, the nuclei were monokaryotic. The merogonial plasmodium divided by binary fission and the sporont gave rise to disporoblastic ovoid spores measuring 4.2 ± 0.4 × 2.8 ± 0.4 μm. In mature spores, the polar filament was arranged in 10–11 (rarely 12) coils in one row in turn of posterior vacuole. The polaroplast had two distinct regions around the manubrium. The polyribosomes were organised in coiled tapes. The small subunit rRNA gene was sequenced and maximum parsimony analysis placed the microsporidian described here in the clade that includes the genera Ichthyosporidium, Loma and Pseudoloma.

"Morphological and molecular biological characterization of Pleistophora aegyptiaca sp. nov. infecting the Red Sea fish Saurida tumbil. One hundred three out of 225 (45.8%) of the Red Sea fish Saurida tumbil were infected with microsporidian parasites. The infection was recorded as tumor-like masses (whitish macroscopic cysts) or xenomas often up to 2 cm in diameter and embedded in the peritoneal cavity. Generally, the infection was increased during winter 63.8% (86 out of 135) and fall to 18.9% (17 out of 90) in summer. Light microscopic study revealed that xenomas were encapsulated by a fibrous layer encircling numerous sporophorous vesicles filled with mature spores measuring 1.7 ± 0.6 (1.5–2.7 μm) × 1.5 ± 0.3 μm (1.2–1.8 μm) in size. Ultrastructural microscopic study showed the presence of smooth membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forming a thick, amorphous coat surrounding various developmental stages of the parasite. The various recognizable stages of the parasite were uninuclear, binucleated, and multinucleated meronts followed by detachment of the plasmalemma of the sporont from the sporophorous vesicle producing sporoblasts. Mature spores consist of a spore coat and spore contents. The spore contents consist of the uninucleated sporoplasm and a posterior vacuole located at the posterior end. The polar tube consists of a straight shaft and a coiled region (26–32 coils) arranged in many rows along the inside periphery of the spore. The polaroplast consisted of an anterior region of closely and loosely packed membranes. Molecular analysis based on the small subunit rDNA gene was performed to determine the phylogenetic position of the present species. The percentage identity between this species and a range of other microsporidia predominantly from aquatic hosts demonstrated a high degree of similarity (>92%) with eight Pleistophora species. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences and divergence showed that the sequence of the present microsporidium was most similar to that of Pleistophora anguillarum (99.8% identity) differing in 13 nucleotide positions.

"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new microsporidian species from the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari, Phytoseiidae). A new microsporidian species is described from the predatory mite Metaseiulus (formerly Typhlodromus or Galendromus) occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari, Phytoseiidae). The ultrastructure of this new species is presented together with the first molecular characterization for a microsporidium of mites. All stages of this new microsporidium are haplokaryotic and develop in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm. Sporogony is disporoblastic and spores are formed in eggs, immature stages, and adults of M. occidentalis. There are two morphological classes of spores, one with a short polar filament (3–5 coils) that measured m and one with a longer polar filament (8–9 coils) that measured m. Horizontal transmission of this new species occurs by cannibalism of eggs and other stages and perhaps involves the spores with the long polar filament. Spores with the short polar filament may play a role in autoinfection and vertical (transovarial) transmission that is highly efficient in transferring the microsporidium from adults to progeny. Analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA indicated that this species from M. occidentalis is most closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade of microsporidia. A conflict between the morphological and molecular data is discussed.

"Morphological and molecular studies of Vairimorpha necatrix BM, a new strain of the microsporidium V. necatrix (microsporidia, burenellidae) recorded in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Graphical abstract Highlights • This is a new study on the Vairimorpha necatrix recorder in the silkworm Bombyx mori. • Diplokaryotic spores (4.7±0.2×2.1±0.2μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 13–17 coils. • Almost all the tissues of silkworm were the targets for Vairimorpha necatrix BM but no infection in the ovary. • There is no vertical transmission in silkworm after Vairimorpha necatrix BM infection. Abstract Vairimorpha sp. BM (2012) is a recent isolate of the microsporidia from the silkworm in Shandong, China. The ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization of this isolate is described in this study. This pathogenic fungus causes pebrine disease in silkworms which manifests as a systemic infection. Meanwhile, the silkworm eggs produced by the infected moths were examined using a microscope and PCR amplification. Neither spores nor the expected PCR band were observed, suggesting that no vertical transmission occurred in Bombyx mori. In addition, the ultrastructure of the isolate was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two types of spores were observed: diplokaroytic spores with 13–17 coils of polar tubes and monokaryotic spores with less coils of polar tubes which could form octospores; however, no sporophorous vesicles were observed. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA genes of Vairimorpha species showed that this isolate has a closer relationship to Vairimorpha necatrix than the other species studied. This result also is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on their actin genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and RNA polymerase II (RPB1).

"Morphology, Molecular Phylogeny, and Ecology of Binucleata daphniae n. g., n. sp. (Fungi: Microsporidia), a Parasite of Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 (Crustacea: Branchiopoda). ABSTRACT . We describe a new microsporidian species Binucleata daphniae, n. g., n. sp., that infects the integument cells lining the hemocoele cavity of the carapace and the postabdomen of the cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus. Infected cells filled with spores accumulate as large clusters in the carapace cavity and heavily infected hosts are detected by their opaque appearance. Despite the parasite's presence, infected Daphnia grow and molt, but have a reduced fecundity. During the parasite's life cycle, chain-like meronts with isolated nuclei are formed, giving rise to binucleate presporonts, the most frequently observed, characteristic developmental stage. In sporogony, the nuclei of the presporont separate, divide, and eight spores enclosed in a thin-walled sporophorous vesicle are formed. Spores are 4.9 × 2.5 μm in size (fresh) and have an anisofilar polar filament with eight coils. DNA sequence analysis places B. daphniae in a clade of microsporidians that parasitize crustaceans and mosquitoes and have assumed complex life cycles. Binucleata daphniae, however, has a simple and direct life cycle and can be transferred to naïve hosts and maintained as persistent infections in populations of its host D. magna. We propose that B. daphniae has simplified its life cycle by losing its secondary host, rendering it unique in this clade.",Binucleata daphniae,pyriform,['pyriform'],{'pyriform'},

A microsporidium was isolated from the bronze birch borer, Agrilus anxius Gory (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), collected near Sudbury and Sault Ste Marie, Canada. Light and electron microscopic investigations showed that gross pathology and ultrastructure of the investigated Cystosporogenes species was similar to those characterized and described for other Cystosporogenes species. Small subunit rRNA gene sequence data and comparative phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the microsporidian species from A. anxius is most closely related to the genus Cystosporogenes clade of microsporidia. Infection average in the Sudbury and Sault Ste Marie beetle populations was >80% and relatively stable in 2006–2007 but declined in 2008.

Microsporidia are zoonotic protozoa which were rare human pathogens prior to 1985, when Enterocytozoon bieneusi was described in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with chronic diarrhea. Another species, Encephalitozoon (Septata) intestinalis, is associated with diarrhea and chronic sinusitis, and approximately 25 cases have been reported in the literature. However, other microsporidial infections in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients remain extremely rare. We report the first case of a Pleistophora sp.-like microsporidian infection presenting as a progressive severe myosotis associated with fever and weight loss. The organism was demonstrated by light microscopy and electron microscopy in corneal scrapings, skeletal muscle, and nasal discharge. Electron microscopy showed an electron-dense surface coat with ''sun-flare''-like projections surrounding all stages of development of meronts (two to four nuclei, dividing by binary fission), sporonts, and sporoblasts. Division of sporonts, in which sporonts separate from the thick outer coat, creating a sporophorous vesicle, is by binary fission, differentiating this organism from Pleistophora sp. The spore measures 4.0 by 2.5 mu m and has a rugose exospore. A new genus and species, Trachipleistophora hominis, has been established for this parasite.

"Myospora metanephrops (n. g., n. sp.) from marine lobsters and a proposal for erection of a new order and family (Crustaceacida; Myosporidae) in the Class Marinosporidia (Phylum Microsporidia). Abstract In this study we describe, the first microsporidian parasite from nephropid lobsters. Metanephrops challengeri were captured from an important marine fishery situated off the south coast of New Zealand. Infected lobsters displayed an unusual external appearance and were lethargic. Histology was used to demonstrate replacement of skeletal and other muscles by merogonic and sporogonic stages of the parasite, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of diplokaryotic meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts and spore stages, all in direct contact with the host sarcoplasm. Analysis of the ssrDNA gene sequence from the lobster microsporidian suggested a close affinity with Thelohania butleri, a morphologically dissimilar microsporidian from marine shrimps. Whilst morphological features of the lobster parasite are consistent with members of the family Nosematidae, molecular data place the parasite closer to members of the family Thelohanidae. Due to the contradiction between morphological and molecular taxonomic data, we propose the erection of a new genus in which the lobster parasite is the type species (Myospora metanephrops). Furthermore, we recommend the erection of a new family (Myosporidae) and a new order (Crustaceacida) to contain this genus. The taxonomic framework presented could be further applied to the re-classification of existing members of the Phylum Microsporidia.",Myospora metanephrops,Elongate,['elongate'],{'elongate'},

A new species of Microsporidia classified to a new genus was observed in the trunk muscle of commercial hake (Merluccius capensis/paradoxus complex) from Namibian fisheries. Macroscopic examination revealed thin and dark filaments inserted among muscle fibers. Inside the filaments were many sporophorous vesicles with about 30–50 spores per vesicle. The shape of the spore was pyriform and the extruded polar filament was of moderate length (up to 4.29 μm, n=12).

Meronts were not observed and the monokaryotic merozoites and sporonts were not contained within either parasitophorous or sporophorous vesicles. Sporonts were disporoblastic and gave rise to monokaryotic sporoblasts that became narrow and elongate as they developed into immature spores with a developing polar filament. The nucleus was not clearly resolved in mature spores and may have been surrounded by the lamellar polaroplast. The polar filament was of nearly uniform diameter throughout most of its length and ended abruptly about three‐fourths of the distance from the anterior end of the spore. Unusual spherical non‐membrane bound granules surrounded the polar filament in a spiral arrangement. The new microsporidium resembles members of the family Mrazekiidiae, but differs in lacking a diplokaryon at any stage. It is probably most closely related to Baculea daphniae from which it differs primarily by spore shape and size. The familial relationships of the genus Baculea have not been determined and it is proposed to include it with Nadelspora in the new family Nadelsporidae.",Nadelspora canceri,needle-shaped; elongate; cylindrical; extremely narrow; posterior tip,"['needle-shaped', 'elongate', 'cylindrical', 'extremely narrow', 'posterior tip']","{'cylindrical', 'needle-shaped', 'posterior tip'}",needle‐shaped

"Nosema adaliae sp. nov., a new microsporidian pathogen from the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and its relationship to microsporidia that infect other coccinellids. Graphical abstract Highlights • This is the first formal description of a microsporidium from Adalia bipunctata. • Diplokaryotic spores (6.10×3.01μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 10–18 coils. • Flight muscles and fat body were the most heavily infected host tissues. • The genome sequence of the microsporidium was 97% similar to Nosema bombi. Abstract The two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., is a tree-dwelling lady beetle endemic to parts of Europe, Central Asia and North America that is commercially available for aphid control in Europe and North America. Lady beetles host a wide variety of symbionts including parasitoids, viruses, eugregarines, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and microsporidia. Four species of microsporidia have been described from lady beetles, and an undescribed microsporidium was recently isolated from local populations of A. bipunctata in Nova Scotia, Canada. In a previous study, this pathogen prolonged the development of A. bipunctata larvae but had no effect on adult fecundity, longevity or sex ratios. The objective of this study was to formally describe the microsporidium by means of its ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Mature spores measured 4.25±0.09×1.82±0.03μm (SE, n=49, from micrographs) and fresh spores measured 6.10±0.06×3.01±0.05μm (±SE, n=60; range: 5.0–6.9×2.18–3.86μm). The polar filament was isofilar with 10–18 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. The lamellar polaroplast was not typically visible and spores contained a relatively small posterior vacuole. Both the flight muscles and fat body were heavily infected and a large number of spores were observed within and between the cells of these tissues. The ovaries, developing oocytes, spermatocytes and accessory glands within the testes, midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ileum, colon, and ventral nerve cord were also infected but not as heavily. Connective tissue near the cuticle and surrounding the trachea were lightly infected. The presence of spores in both the alimentary canal and ovaries (particularly within developing oocytes) suggests that the microsporidium can be transmitted per os (horizontally) and transovarially (vertically). Molecular analysis of the genome of the microsporidium described in this study was 97% similar to Nosema bombi and 96% similar to Nosema thomsoni, Nosema vespula and Nosema oulemae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in A. bipunctata be given the name Nosema adaliae sp. Nov.",Nosema adaliae,oval,['oval'],{'oval'},

A new microsporidian parasite Nosema chrysorrhoeae n. sp., isolated in Bulgaria from the browntail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea L.), is described. Its life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles that are similar to the general developmental cycles of the Nosema-like microsporidia and are indistinguishable from those of two Nosema spp. from Lymantria dispar. The primary cycle takes place in the midgut tissues and produces binucleate primary spores. The secondary developmental cycle takes place exclusively in the silk glands and produces binucleate environmental spores. N. chrysorrhoeae is specific to the browntail moth.

Abstract We describe a unique microsporidian species that infects the green stink bug, Chinavia hilaris; the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys; the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus; and the dusky stink bug, Euschistus tristigmus. All life stages are unikaryotic, but analysis of the consensus small subunit region of the ribosomal gene places this microsporidium in the genus Nosema, which historically has been characterized by diplokaryotic life stages. It is also characterized by having the reversed arrangement of the ribosomal gene (LSU –ITS‐ SSU) found in species within the “true Nosema” clade. This microsporidium is apparently Holarctic in distribution. It is present in H. halys both where it is native in Asia and where it is invasive in North America, as well as in samples of North American native C. hilaris collected prior to the introduction of H. halys from Asia.

Merogony and sporogony were by binary fission of diplokaryotic stages. Fresh spores were elongate, slightly pointed at the anterior end, and measured 4.7 x 2.0 microm. Ultrastructural features of special interest were 20-nm tubules connecting the surface of sporonts with host cell cytoplasm and, in the spores, a deeply domed polar sac, polaroplast consisting of closely packed longitudinally arranged membranes and loosely packed horizontally arranged membranes, and 10.5-14 coils of the polar tube in a single rank.

The larvae were maintained under laboratory conditions in salt concentrations of 10 g/l and 20 g/l of water. Daily recordings of the mortality of the larvae were made and the dates of change of instar were noted. Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages.

"Paradoxium irvingi n.gen. n.sp. (Microsporidia) infecting the musculature of European pink shrimp Pandalus montagui. This paper utilises histological, ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic data to describe a novel genus and species (Paradoxium irvingi n.gen., n.sp.) within clade 5 of the phylum Microsporidia. The parasite infects the musculature of the pink shrimp Pandalus montagui captured from United Kingdom waters. The novel microsporidium is morphologically and phylogenetically dissimilar to its nearest phylogenetic branch relative Thelohania butleri infecting the sister shrimp taxon Pandalus jordani. Furthermore, it is morphologically distinct from the type species of the genus Thelohania, Thelohania giardi infecting European brown shrimp Crangon crangon. Since phylogenetic data pertaining to type T. giardi is not currently available, our discovery places some doubt on the likelihood that T. butleri represents the proposed surrogate for the type taxon. Further it demonstrates potential for significant morphological plasticity in this clade of muscle-infecting microsporidians of crustaceans which contains the genera Myospora, Cucumispora, Thelohania, and now Paradoxium. Since it cannot be stated with certainty that T. butleri (or other taxa within the clade) represent true close relatives of T. giardi, clarity on this issue will only occur with re-discovery and genotyping of type T. giardi infecting C. crangon from European waters.",Paradoxium irvingi,oval,['oval'],{'oval'},
"Parahepatospora carcini n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of invasive Carcinus maenas with intermediate features of sporogony between the Enterocytozoon clade and other microsporidia. Parahepatospora carcini n. gen. n. sp., is a novel microsporidian parasite discovered infecting the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas of a single Carcinus maenas specimen. The crab was sampled from within its invasive range in Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia). Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were used to show the development of the parasite within a simple interfacial membrane, culminating in the formation of unikaryotic spores with 5–6 turns of an isofilar polar filament. Formation of a multinucleate meront (>12 nuclei observed) preceded thickening and invagination of the plasmodial membrane, and in many cases, formation of spore extrusion precursors (polar filaments, anchoring disk) prior to complete separation of pre-sporoblasts from the sporogonial plasmodium. This developmental feature is intermediate between the Enterocytozoonidae (formation of spore extrusion precursors within the sporont plasmodium) and all other Microsporidia (formation of spore extrusion precursors after separation of sporont from the sporont plasmodium). SSU rRNA-based gene phylogenies place P. carcini within microsporidian Clade IV, between the Enterocytozoonidae and the so-called Enterocytospora-clade, which includes Enterocytospora artemiae and Globulispora mitoportans. Both of these groups contain gut-infecting microsporidians of aquatic invertebrates, fish and humans.

"Paranucleospora theridion n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporidia, Enterocytozoonidae) with a Life Cycle in the Salmon Louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis, Copepoda) and Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). ABSTRACT . Paranucleospora theridion n. gen, n. sp., infecting both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and its copepod parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis is described. The microsporidian exhibits nuclei in diplokaryotic arrangement during all known life-cycle stages in salmon, but only in the merogonal stages and early sporogonal stage in salmon lice. All developmental stages of P. theridion are in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. In salmon, two developmental cycles were observed, producing spores in the cytoplasm of phagocytes or epidermal cells (Cycle-I) and in the nuclei of epidermal cells (Cycle-II), respectively. Cycle-I spores are small and thin walled with a short polar tube, and are believed to be autoinfective. The larger oval intranuclear Cycle-II spores have a thick endospore and a longer polar tube, and are probably responsible for transmission from salmon to L. salmonis. Parasite development in the salmon louse occurs in several different cell types that may be extremely hypertrophied due to P. theridion proliferation. Diplokaryotic merogony precedes monokaryotic sporogony. The rounded spores produced are comparable to the intranuclear spores in the salmon in most aspects, and likely transmit the infection to salmon. Phylogenetic analysis of P. theridion partial rDNA sequences place the parasite in a position between Nucleospora salmonis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based on characteristics of the morphology, unique development involving a vertebrate fish as well as a crustacean ectoparasite host, and the results of the phylogenetic analyses it is suggested that P. theridion should be given status as a new species in a new genus.",Paranucleospora theridion,Spherical,['spherical'],{'spherical'},oval; rounded

"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii. BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",Cucumispora roeselii,oval,['oval'],{'oval'},
"Parathelohania iranica sp. nov. (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae) infecting malaria mosquito Anopheles superpictus (Diptera: Culicidae): Ultrastructure and molecular characterization. Microsporidia are common pathogens of insects and sometimes are considered as a candidate in the biological control of mosquitoes. Recently a microsporidium infection was discovered in Anopheles superpictus (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, in Iran. The responsible agent belonged to the genus Parathelohania (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae). This study has been carried out to identify its identity at the species level. Fresh infected larvae were collected from the type locality, Kiar district, in Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari province, at the central western of Iran. Superficial and the internal ultrastructure of the recovered spores were explored by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Molecular techniques were also employed to amplify parts of its ssu rDNA. The obtained data were compared with the available information of congener species and other closely related microsporidia to elucidate evolutionary relationship. A small apical depression and two posterolateral ridges extending backward from a pear shaped anterior body mass were notable under scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed 2 broad and 3–4 narrow coils in the either side of spores, respectively. The sequence of a 1062 nucleotide fragment of ssu rDNA was determined by means of PCR technique. This study indicates that the microsporidium infecting An. superpictus differs from other previously described species in the genus Parathelohania. It means that the microsporidium infecting An. superpictus is a new species and hereby it is called Parathelohania iranica.

Nosema locustae did not produce detectable infections in Mormon crickets in any stage of development. While nymphal development was retarded among insects inoculated as first to third instars with high spore concentrations (106/mg bran), no reductions in survival or oviposition were obtained. A new species of microsporidian (Vairimorpha n. sp.) was isolated from Mormon crickets near Dinosaur National Monument. In laboratory cage tests, this pathogen produced significant mortality among first to third instar Mormon crickets treated with a bran bait containing 106 spores/mg. Lower concentrations (104/mg and 102/mg) did not significantly affect survival, but retarded nymphal development and yielded heavy infections. Crickets inoculated as seventh instars to adults did not exhibit significant changes in survival, infection, or oviposition relative to controls. Before N. locustae can contribute to Mormon cricket management, a ""cricket strain"" of this pathogen must be isolated and tested.

We recently discovered infections by a microsporidium closely related to Nosema fumiferanae in field populations of the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in the San Francisco region of California. E. postvittana originates from Australia and was first detected in California in 2006; therefore, our aim was to identify and determine the origin of the Nosema isolate. We characterized the pathogenicity, transmission pathways, and ultrastructure of this new Nosema isolate. In addition, we sequenced fragments of commonly used genetic markers (ITS, SSU, and RPB1), and examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Nosema isolate and other microsporidian species commonly found in lepidopteran hosts. The pathogenicity of the Nosema isolate was investigated by infecting second instar larvae of E. postvittana. Larval and pupal survivorship were reduced by 7% and 13% respectively, and pupation occurred 1–2d later in infected individuals than in healthy individuals. Emerging infected females died 5d earlier than healthy females, and daily fecundity was 22% lower. Hatch rate also was 22% lower for eggs oviposited by infected females. Vertical transmission was confirmed; spores were present in 68% of egg masses and 100% of the surviving larvae from infected females. Ultrastructure images, together with sequences from selected genetic markers, confirmed the Nosema isolate to be a member of the Nosema fumiferanae species complex (Nosema fumiferanae postvittana subsp. n.).

A study was undertaken to isolate entomopathogens of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyer, and southern corn stalk borer, Diatraea crambidoides (Grote). Field- collected diapausing larvae of southwestern corn borer (three sites in Mississippi) and southern corn stalk borer (one site in North Carolina), and a laboratory strain of D. grandiosella in the diapause state were maintained in a simulated winter followed by a simulated spring environment. Few larvae (#6%) collected from any of the Þeld sites died in the winter environment, and most insect mortality (11Ð25%) occurred after transfer of the larvae to the simulated spring environment. Mortality during the simulated spring period differed among the collection sites, and the highest mortality was recorded for southwestern corn borers from Washington County (25%), followed by Marshall (16%) and Oktibbeha (11%) Counties. A high level of mortality was also observed in southern corn stalk borers during the simulated spring period (27%). No viruses were observed, but a number of bacteria, microsporidia, and fungi were isolated from both southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae. In most instances, numerous bacterial taxa were isolated from cadavers, but on some occasions a single taxon predominated. The most prevalent bacterial taxon from larval and pupal cadavers was Enterococcus faecalis (Andrewes & Horder) Schleifer & Kilpper-Balz, but Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula, and Serratia marcescens Bizio were frequently isolated as well. Few fungi (1Ð7%) were recovered from southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae.

Mature spores were oval and measured 2.58±0.21μm×1.34±0.24μm, with 16 to approximately 32 spores in a parasitophorous vacuole. The spores were uninucleate and polar filament coils numbered 8–9 situated in a single row. The spore polaroplast consisted of an anterior lamellar section and a posterior vesicular section, and the posterior vacuole was reduced. Analyses of a 1221bp partial SSU-rRNA sequence indicated that the isolate is more closely related to the Endoreticulatus clade than to Cystosporogenes, but shows earlier phylogenetic separation from species infecting Lepidoptera and represents a new species, Endoreticulatus poecilimonae. To compare sequences of Endoreticulatus spp. from Lepidoptera to those infecting other insect orders, an isolate, Microsporidium itiiti Malone (1985), described from the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, was sequenced. Like the grasshopper isolate, the weevil isolate is closely related but basal to the lepidopteran Endoreticulatus clade.

"Septata Intestinalis N. G., N. Sp., an Intestinal Microsporidian Associated With Chronic Diarrhea and Dissemination In Aids Patients. Intestinal microsporidiosis in patients diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and having chronic diarrhea was first reported in 1985 and the associated microsporidian was named Enterocytozoon bieneusi. the intracellular developmental cycle of E. bieneusi in enterocytes has been demonstrated and many cases have been reported worldwide. This report presents the life cycle of a second intestinal microsporidian, associated with the same symptoms, in five AIDS patients. This new microsporidian also infects enterocytes but its pathology and morphology differ from that of E. bieneusi. It involves lamina propria macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and can disseminate to infect other parts of the body, e.g. the kidney and gall bladder. the parasite cycle includes development of rounded uninucleate and elongated bi‐ or tetranucleate cells without the formation of plasmodial stages. Sporogony is similar to the more typical development of microsporidia with sporoblast morphogenesis occurring after the last cell division. the development of cells within chambers of a septate, honeycomb‐like, parasite‐secreted fibrillar network and surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole, however, is unique to this microsporidian, justifying the establishment of a new genus and species, Septata intestinalis n. g., n. sp.",Encephalitozoon intestinalis (= Septata intestinalis) (1),oval (from figures),['oval'],{'oval'},

"Specified ultrastructural data on Tubulinosema maroccanus Comb. Nov. (Nosema maroccanus Krilova et Nurzhanov, 1987) (Microsporidia) from the Moroccan locust Dociostaurus maroccanus (Orthoptera). Nosema maroccanus Krilova et Nurzhanov, 1987 was isolated from the Moroccan locust Dociostaurus maroccanus Thunb. in Uzbekistan. Its description, based on one of the first ultrastructural studies of microsporidia from orthopteran hosts, lacked information on the details of cell surface structure, which are considered to be very important in modern taxonomy. We have re-investigated the material upon which the original description of N. maroccanus was based and revealed new ultrastructural characters of its cell surface. Late meronts are surrounded with microtubuli, about 20 nm in diameter, attached to the membrane, later replaced with electron dense granules, forming a typical coating of the sporont's surface (the primordium of exospore). Mature spores are also surrounded with a layer of microtubuli. Host cell cytoplasm contains small vesicles with electron-dense cores, up to 50 nm in diameter, surrounding late meronts, sporogonial stages and spores of the parasite. Polar tube is slightly anisofilar. These characters disagree with the diagnosis of Nosema, but fit that of the recently established genus Tubulinosema. Hence, we transferred the species studied into this genus, establishing Tubulinosema maroccanus comb. nov. Analysis of cell surface ultrastructure of two Tubulinosema species from Orthoptera showed that they shared two characters not mentioned in the diagnosis of the genus. Therefore, the diagnosis of Tubulinosema was modified to include two more characters: presence of vesicles with electron-dense cores surrounding sporogonial stages and presence of microtubuli not only in late meronts, but also, in some species, in spores.",Tubulinosema maroccanus,oval; ovoid,"['oval', 'ovoid']","{'oval', 'ovoid'}",

A microsporidian isolated from the lawn grass cutworm, Spodoptera depravata Butler had two nuclei in diplokaryotic arrangement throughout its development. A sporont gave rise to two spores, and there was no sporophorous vesicle. This microsporidium produced two types of spores, those with 2 to 3 coils and those with 11 to 12 coils of the polar tube during development in Antheraea eucalypti cells. Larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, were not infected by the microsporidium when the spores were administered perorally.

And a microsporidian Nosema ptinidorum n. sp. Both parasites invade the fat body of adults of host-animals. The larvae remained free from infection. The two new pathogens are described and pictured. This is the first report on coccidian and microsporidian parasites found in stored product pests of the Family Ptinidae, Coleoptera.Three species of microsporidia from a population of winter moths, Operophtera brumata (L.), were examined by light microscopy. Pleistophora operophterae (Canning, 1960) is redescribed. The stages with one or two nuclei which were originally termed presporonts are now interpreted as fragments of disrupted vacuolated sporonts or prematuraly separated sporoblasts. The range of spore numbers within sporophorous vesicles is modified to 4 to c.60, rather than 10 to c.100. This species cannot be retained in the genus Pleistophora Gurley, 1893, redefined by Canning & Nicholas (1980), but ultrastructural studies are required before taxonomic reassignment is attempted. Nosema operophterae Canning, 1960 is also redescribed. Merogony consists mainly of binary fission of binucleate and tetranucleate stages but large irregular-shaped multinucleate meronts were also present. Ribbon-shaped sporonts with two, four or eight linearly-spaced nuclei give rise, via binucleate segments, to chains of uninucleate sporoblasts. The species is transferred to a new genus Orthosoma n.g. as Orthosoma operophterae (Canning, 1960) since its isolated nuclei and polysporoblastic sporogony are not characteristic of the genus Nosema Nägeli, 1857. The third species Nosema operophterae Purrini & Skatulla, 1979 is renamed N. wistmansi nom.nov. because the name given by Purrini & Skatulla was preoccupied and is now a synonym of O. operophterae. Details of the developmental stages of N. wistmansi are given, which show that it is typical of the genus Nosema, with nuclei in diplokaryon arrangement and with disporoblastic sporogony.

A new microsporidian Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. was isolated from a muscle lesion of the streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus Cuvier, 1798 (Mammalia, Tenrecidae), an insectivore endemic to Madagascar. The spores isolated from the tenrec were infectious to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intramuscular injection. Material obtained from muscular lesions in mice was used for the parasite description. All developmental stages of the microsporidian were covered by a dense coat, which during sporogony changed into the sporophorous vesicle wall. Eight, 16, 32, or more spores were formed inside the sporophorous vesicle as the result of the division by plasmotomy and sequential fission of a multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium. Spores were ovoid, 4.7 × 2.8 μm in size, had a large posterior vacuole, and had an isofilar polar tube with 15–16 coils. Although the fine structure and the developmental pattern of the organism were in some respects similar to the genus Vavraia, molecular phylogeny based on the gene sequences of the small subunit rRNA and RNA polymerase subunit II indicated that the organism belongs to the genus Trachipleistophora.

"Ultrastructural and molecular characterization of Bacillidium vesiculoformis n. sp. (Microspora: Mrazekiidae) in the freshwater oligochaete Nais simplex (Oligochaeta: Naididae). The development of a new species, Bacillidium vesiculoformis n. sp. (Microspora, Mrazekiidae), is described from the freshwater oligochaete Nais simplex (Oligochaeta, Naididae). Initial stages of parasite development consist of a monokaryotic merogony within a haemocyte of the intestinal blood sinus. The resulting hypertrophied haemocyte is attached to the chloragocytes of the sinus by fine cytoplasmic extensions with the sinus around the cell becoming greatly enlarged. The meronts within the haemocyte form diplokaryotic sporonts that undergo sporogenesis directly within the cytoplasm of the host cell. The infected cell becomes packed with spores and developmental stages, causing it dramatically to increase in size, eventually rupturing the oligochaete and cell. Sporogony appears to be disporoblastic. Released spores were observed to have an adhesive quality. Transmission studies conducted with mature spores failed to transmit the parasite horizontally although vertical transmission was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of the parasite demonstrated that B. vesiculoformis clustered with microsporidian parasites of bryozoa and two other microsporidians, Janacekia debaiseuxi and an unidentified Bacillidium sp.",Bacillidium vesiculoformis,bacilliform,['bacilliform'],{'bacilliform'},
"Ultrastructural characterisation and molecular taxonomic identification of Nosema granulosis n. sp., a transovarially transmitted feminising (TTF) microsporidium. A novel microsporidian parasite is described, which infects the crustacean host Gammarus duebeni. The parasite was transovarially transmitted and feminised host offspring. The life cycle was monomorphic with three stages. Meronts were found in host embryos, juveniles, and in the gonadal tissue of adults. Sporoblasts and spores were restricted to the gonad. Sporogony was disporoblastic giving rise to paired sporoblasts, which then differentiated to form spores. Spores were not found in regular groupings and there was no interfacial envelope. Spores were approximately 3.78 x 1.22 microns and had a thin exospore wall, a short polar filament, and an unusual granular polaroplast. All life cycle stages were diplokaryotic. A region from the parasite small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on these data places the parasite within the genus Nosema.

"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching. Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Amblyospora bakcharia; Amblyospora baritia; Amblyospora bogashovia; Amblyospora chulymia; Amblyospora hristinia; Amblyospora jurginia; Amblyospora kazankia; Amblyospora mavlukevia; Amblyospora mocrushinia; Amblyospora modestium; Amblyospora salairia; Amblyospora severinia; Amblyospora shegaria; Amblyospora timirasia; Novothelohania ovalae,Broadly ovoid || Broadly ovoid || Broadly ovoid || Broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || broadly ovoid || oval,"['broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'broadly ovoid', 'oval']",{'broadly ovoid'},
"Ultrastructural characterization of Acarispora falculifera n.gen., n.sp., a new microsporidium (Opisthokonta: Chytridiopsida) from the feather mite Falculifer rostratus (Astigmata: Pterolichoidea). Only about 20 species of microsporidia have been described from mites. All except one species produce typical spores with a long polar filament and a polaroplast. This paper is the first study of an atypical microsporidium infection in a feather mite (Falculifer rostratus). The infection of the pigeon feather mite is restricted to the colon epithelium where it leads to hypertrophy of the concerned cells. During sporogony, a multinucleate plasmodial aggregate is formed within a sporont (endogenous sporogony resulting in a polysporophorous vesicle). The cisterns delimiting the single sporoblasts later form the spore walls. Sporogonial stages are in direct contact to the host cell cytoplasm. Merogonial stages were not present. Spores are tiny (3.6 μm × 2.6 μm), broad oval in form and monokaryotic. The spore wall of mature spores consists of a three-layered endospore and a thin, electron-dense, wavy exospore. The polar filament is anisofilar and completely coiled in 3–4 turns. In cross-sections, it has a star-like appearance because the electron-dense core forms rounded compartments of lucent material at its surface. In superficial sections, this results in a honeycomb-like pattern. A polaroplast is missing. The polar filament arises subapically at a polar sac that lacks an internal anchoring disk. These atypical spore structures clearly classify the species from the feather mite as a member of the order Chytridiopsida. It could not be clearly affiliated to one of the known genera, so we created a new genus, Acarispora, with the species A.

"Ultrastructural description and phylogeny of a novel microsporidian, Glugea eda n. sp. from the striated fusilier, Caesio striata, in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia. Glugea eda n. sp. is described from the mesenteries of the striated fusilier, Caesio striata, collected from the Red Sea coast off Yanbu' al Bahr, Saudi Arabia. Numerous blackish xenomas, ranged from 3 to 5 mm, were found in the body cavity associated with the mesenteries. Mature spores are monomorphic, ellipsoidal with an average size of 5(4–6) μm in length and 2.2 (2–3) μm in width. Observations of the ultrastructure revealed that the development was asynchronous and that the nuclei were isolated throughout the life cycle with uninucleate meronts. Sporoblasts were uninucleated and existed together with sporonts in a fully formed parasitophorous vacuole. The polar filament of the mature spore was isofilar with 24–28 coils, arranged in three rows. Phylogenetic analysis placed the current microsporidia within the clade grouping Glugea species and close to the species described from the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. The morphometric and molecular comparison with other members of the genus Glugea evidenced the taxonomic novelty of the present form, suggesting that it should be considered as a new species.

The new microsporidium Flabelliforma magnivora sp. n. is described based primarily on ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial and sporogonial reproductions are by rosette- or finger-like budding. The sporogony yields 4-16, most frequently 12, sporoblasts. A fragile sporophorous vesicle is formed by the sporont. Spores are lightly pyriform, with both poles blunt, often with one surface slightly convex. Unfixed spores measure 2.34-3.03 x 4.07-4.93 μm. The exospore, which is five-layered with an internal double-layer, measures 35-40 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar with 14-17, 77-94 nm wide coils arranged in two irregular layers of coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast, which ends close to the anterior polar filament coils, is composed of two regions of regularly arranged lamellae: narrow lamellae anteriorly, wider lamellae posteriorly. The host is the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The primary site of infection is the fat body, but infection was also observed in the hypodermic cells and the ovaries. In the laboratory the parasites are transmitted with nearly 100% fidelity from mother to offspring. Transversely sectioned polyribosomes appeared as characteristic circular configurations of 9 ribosomes.

The new microsporidium Ordospora colligata gen. et sp. n. is described with emphasis on the ultrastructural characteristics. The parasite, which is superficially similar to Glugoides intestinalis (Chatton, 1907), invades the gut epithelium of Daphnia magna, where the complete development takes place in a host cell-derived parasitophorous vacuole. Merogonial and sporogonial stages occur together in the vacuole, with presporal stages at the periphery, mature spores aggregated in the centre. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial plasmodia are initially rounded, later elongated, and they give rise to four merozoites. The bouts of merogony are unknown. The sporont produces two sporoblast mother cells, which often remain coupled. Each cell generates a chain of four sporoblasts. Sporophorous vesicles are not produced. Mature spores are pyriform with a pointed anterior pole and with an obliquely positioned posterior vacuole. Unfixed spores measure 1.33-2.29 x 2.32-3.69 μm. The exospore is uniform, about 11 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar, 82-85 nm wide, making 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast is uniform, composed of about 28 nm, wide lamellar components, where the lamellae are folded around each other.

"Ultrastructure and Development of Pleistophora ronneafiei n. sp., a Microsporidium (Protista) in the Skeletal Muscle of an Immune-Compromised Individual. ABSTRACT. This report provides a detailed ultrastructural study of the life cycle, including proliferative and sporogonic developmental stages, of the first Pleistophora species (microsporidium) obtained from an immune-incompetent patient. In 1985, the organism obtained from a muscle biopsy was initially identified as belonging to the genus Pleistophora, based on spore morphology and its location in a sporophorous vesicle. Since that initial report, at least two new microsporidial genera, Trachipleistophora and Brachiola, have been reported to infect the muscle tissue of immunologically compromised patients. Because Trachipleistophora development is similar to Pleistophora, and as Pleistophora was only known to occur in cold-blooded hosts, the question of the proper classification of this microsporidium arose. The information acquired in this study makes it possible to compare Pleistophora sp. (Ledford et al. 1985) to the known human infections and properly determine its correct taxonomic position. Our ultrastructural data have revealed the formation of multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia, a developmental characteristic of the genus Pleistophora and not Trachipleistophora. A comparison with other species of the genus supports the establishment of a new species.

Ultrastructure and pathology of Microsporidium phytoseiuli n. sp. infecting the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot is described using light and transmission electron microscopy. Infected mites showed no gross, external symptoms. All observed stages of the parasite had unpaired nuclei. Schizonts were commonly observed within nuclei of digestive cells of the ventriculus and within the cytoplasm of cells lining the cecal wall and in muscle tissue underlying it. Sporoblasts and spores occurred in the nuclei and cytoplasm of digestive cells within the ventriculus, in cortical regions of the sub- and supraesophageal ganglia, within the cecal wall and muscle tissue, and in parenchyma cells underlying the cuticle.

"Ultrastructure and life cycle of Merocinta davidii gen et sp. nov, a dimorphic microsporidian parasite of Mansonia africana (Diptera: Culicidae) from Tanzania. Mansonia africana larvae were sampled at three sites in NE Tanzania, between June and September 1987. At each site between 2.5 and 5.7% were infected with a multisporous microsporidian parasite. The ovoid spores measured 2.5 × 1.5 •m. Meronts were diplokaryotic with electron-dense, thickened unit membranes. Repeated division of the diplokarya gave rise to multinucleate plasmodia, the plasma membrane of which was entirely surrounded by two other membranes interpreted as host endoplasmic reticulum. Both membranes were studded with ribosomes. Meronts became ribbon-like before division, the endoplasmic reticulum dividing with the parasite. At the onset of sporogony the two nuclei of the diplokaryon separated and the electron-dense coat was sloughed off. Nuclear division and cytoplasmic division gave rise to uninucleate sporoblasts and spores. Adult M. africana collected at one of the three sites were infected with two diplokaryotic microsporidia, designated Type A and Type B, which differed only in the size of the spores. Spores of Type A measured 3.4 ×1.8 •m and those of Type B measured 6.6 × 2.9 •m; both types were binucleate. Type A infected 10.8 and Type B 5.8% of the adults collected. Mixed infections were not observed. In transovarial transmission trials, larvae were not successfully reared from adults infected with Type B. However, 11.3% of progeny from females infected with Type A exhibited multisporous microsporidian infections indistinguishable from those found in larvae collected at that site, showing that the multisporous parasite in larvae and the Type A infection of adults represent different stages in the life cycle of a single species.

"Ultrastructure and molecular characterization of a microsporidium, Tubulinosema hippodamiae, from the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville. Graphical abstract Research highlights ► The genomic sequence of the microsporidium was 98–99% similar to Tubulinosema. ► Pathogen ultrastructure is similar to those that define the genus Tubulinosema. ► Aberrant spores filled with lamellar or vesicular structures were observed. ► Host range and tissue pathology overlap with microsporidia from other coccinellids. ► This pathogen may be Nosema hippodamiae, described in 1959 by light microscopy. Abstract Hippodamia convergens, the convergent lady beetle, is available for aphid control in home gardens and in commercial food production systems throughout the United States and Canada. Beetles received from commercial insectaries for biological control are occasionally infected with a microsporidium. The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen by means of ultrastructure, molecular characterization and tissue pathology. All stages of the microsporidium were in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Early developmental stages were proximal to mature spores and both were observed throughout the tissue sections that were examined. Merogony resulted from binary fission. Early-stage sporoblasts were surrounded by a highly convoluted plasma membrane and contained an electron-dense cytoplasm and diplokaryon. Ovoid to elongated late-stage sporoblasts were surrounded by a relatively complete spore wall. The polar filament, polaroplast, and anchoring disk were readily observed within the cell cytoplasm. Mature spores were typical of terrestrial microsporidia, with a thickened endospore surrounded by a thin exospore. Spores contained well-defined internal structures, including a diplokaryon, lamellar polaroplast and a slightly anisofilar polar filament with 10–14 coils arranged in a single or double row. A prominent indentation was evident at the apical end of the spore wall proximal to the anchoring disk. Aberrant spores were also observed. These had a fully developed endospore and exospore but lacked any discernable internal spore structures, and were, instead, filled with lamellar or vesicular structures. Typical and aberrant spores measured 3.58±0.2×2.06±0.2μm (n=10) and 3.38±0.8×2.13±0.2μm (n=10), respectively. Spores were observed in longitudinal muscle surrounding the midgut and within the fat body, Malpighian tubules, pyloric valve epithelium, ventral nerve cord ganglia, muscles and ovaries. The hindgut epithelium was often infected but the connective tissues were rarely invaded. The life cycle and pathology of the microsporidium bears some resemblance to Nosema hippodamiae, the only microsporidium reported from H. convergens by Lipa and Steinhaus in 1959. Molecular characterization of the pathogen genomic DNA revealed that it is 99% similar to Tubulinosema acridophagus and T. ratisbonensis, two pathogens that infect Drosophila melanogaster and 98% similar to T. kingi from D. willistoni.

(Microsporidia: Glugeidae) infecting the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus (Pisces: Synodontidae) inhabiting the Red Sea. Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease distributed worldwide, impacting wild and farmed-raised fish in both fresh and marine water environments. Twenty three out of 130 (17.69%) of the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus were found to be naturally infected with microsporidian parasites. The rate of parasitic infection was increased during winter reaching 29.23% (19/65) and fall to 6.15% (4/65) in summer. The infection was recorded as numerous macroscopic whitish cysts reached 3.8–6.5 mm in diameter embedded in the abdominal cavity, skeletal muscles and mesenteric tissues of the infected fish inducing an enormous hypertrophy of infected tissues. Light microscopic examination revealed that parasitic foci were encapsulated by a host–derived fibrous membrane containing different developmental stages of the parasite. Spores were oval to pyriform in shape. Transmission electron microscopic study showed the presence of smooth membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forming a thick, amorphous coat surrounding the various developmental stages of the examined parasite (meronts, sporont, sporoblasts, and spores). Mature spores were electron dense and uninucleate. The anchoring disk was found in a central position at the anterior end of the spore and a large vacuole was located at the posterior end. There was a definite number (7–8) of the polar filament turns. Molecular analysis based on the 16 small subunit (SSU) rDNA gene was performed to determine the phylogenetic position of the present parasite species. A 615 bp region of the 16SSU rDNA gene of the studied parasite was sequenced and deposited in GenBank under the accession number MF769371.

"Ultrastructure of the development of a species of Encephalitozoon cultured from the eye of an AIDS patient. Human fibroblast cell cultures inoculated with microsporidia-infected corneal scrapings from an AIDS patient were fixed in situ and examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The parasite grew prolifically and all developmental stages were observed. Meronts underwent binary fission and the daughter cells transformed into clongate, chain-like sporonts that eventually separated into sporoblasts. The formation of components of the mature spores is described. The parasite, a species of Encephalitozoon, underwent development both in the cytoplasm and within a parasitophorous vacuole, distinguishing it from the morphologically similar species E. cuniculi and E. hellem, both of which have been described from lesions in the human eye and have been reported to develop exclusively within a parasitophorous vacuole.",Encephalitozoon sp. 3,ellipsoidal,['ellipsoidal'],{'ellipsoidal'},

Unusual polar filament structure in two Microsporidia from water reservoirs with radionuclide and organic pollution. Two species of microsporidia with an unusual polar filament structure were found in Cricotopus silvestris and Microtendipes pedellus larvae which were collected near the zone of influence of the Chernobyl atomic power station (Ukraine) and from a high polluted pond in the Mazurian region of Poland. The first microsporidium has separate unikaryotic spores and was assigned to the family Unikaryonidae Sprague. The diameter of the middle coil of the triple-coiled polar filament of this microsporidium was larger than its two other coils. The observed polar filament was thus neither of isofilar nor of the classical anisofilar type. The second polysporoblastic microsporidium has unikaryotic spores and an uncoiled polar filament and was placed in the family Thelohaniidae Hazard and Oldacre. The rare single macrospores of this microsporidium have a double set of the polar filament complex. The relationship between ultrastructural features of microsporidian spores and water pollution is discussed.,Mutated Thelohaniidae sp.; Mutated Unikaryonidae sp.,ovocylindrical || broadly oval,"['ovocylindrical', 'broadly oval']","{'broadly oval', 'ovocylindrical'}",
"Use of Nucleotide Sequence Data to Identify a Microsporidian Pathogen of Pieris rapae(Lepidoptera, Pieridae). Nucleotide sequence was determined for a portion of genomic DNA which spans the V4 variable region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of an unidentified microsporidium from the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae(174 base pairs). Comparison with equivalent sequence data obtained here for two other microsporidian species, Nosema bombycis (240 base pairs) and Nosema bombi (200 base pairs), and from the GenBank database for 11 other microsporidian species suggests that the unidentified species from P. rapaeis most closely related to some Vairimorpha species. Light and electron microscopic observations of the developmental stages of this parasite were in accord with this. Infection experiments conducted at 20 and 26°C demonstrated temperature-dependent dimorphism, with the production of both binucleate free spores (mean dimensions: 3.8 × 1.8 μm; 10–13 polar filament coils) and membrane-bound uninucleate octospores (mean dimensions of 3.1 × 1.9 μm). Macrospores (mean dimensions 8.0 × 2.1 μm) were also observed. Sites of infection were the gut epithelium, the Malpighian tubules, the salivary glands, and the fat body. Infections were found in all insect life stages, including the egg. This microsporidium was found to be indistinguishable from both Nosema mesnili (Paillot) and Microsporidium (Thelohania) mesnili (Paillot) and we propose that these species be combined and transferred to the genus Vairimorpha Pilley.",Vairimorpha sp.

Mature free spores are often present by the time the larvae pupate, but mature octospores are found only in adult hosts.

"Vairimorpha imperfecta n.sp., a microsporidian exhibiting an abortive octosporous sporogony in Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae). The microsporidian genus Nosema is characterized by development in direct control with host cell cytoplasm, diplokaryotic nuclei throughout development and disporous sporogony. The genus Vairimorpha exhibits the same features plus an octoporous sporogony producing uninucleate spores in a sporophorous vesicle. A microsporidium from diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, falls between Nosema and Vairimorpha in that it initiates but fails to complete the octosporous sequence in this host. The name Vairimorpha imperfecta n.sp. is proposed. Merogony is mainly by formation of buds from multinucleate meronts, the buds remaining attached in chains. Diplokaryotic spores measure 4.3 x 2.0 microns (fresh) and have 15.5 coils of the polar tube in 1 rank. The octosporous sporogony is aborted owing to irregular formation of nuclear spindles, incomplete cytoplasmic fission and bizarre deposition of electron-dense episporontal secretions. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the small subunit rRNA genes of V. imperfecta and of several Nosema and Vairimorpha spp. place V. imperfecta in a clade with Nosema spp. from Lepidoptera rather than in the clade containing the more typical species of Vairimorpha. It is suggested that the ancestors of the Vairimorpha/Nosema complex of species exhibited both disporous and octosporous sporogonies, as does the type species of Vairimorpha, Vairimorpha necatrix. It would follow that true Nosema spp. have lost the ability to express an octosporous sequence and that V. imperfecta is in the process of losing it. It is proposed that the genera Nosema and Vairimorpha be placed in the same family Nosematidae Labbé 1899, rather than in separate families and orders as at present.",Vairimorpha imperfecta,ovoid,['ovoid'],{'ovoid'},
"ankovaia semitubulata gen. et sp. n. (Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae) from nymphs of mayflies Cloeon dipterum L. (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) in Western Siberia. Abstract The ultrastructure of a new microsporidian, Pankovaia semitubulata gen. et sp. n. (Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae), from the fat body of Cloeon dipterum (L.) (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) is described. The species is monokaryotic throughout the life cycle, developing in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Sporogonial plasmodium divides into 2–8 sporoblasts. Each sporoblast, then spore, is enclosed in an individual sporophorous vesicle. Fixed and stained spores of the type species P. semitubulata are 3.4×1.9μm in size. The polaroplast is bipartite (lamellar and vesicular). The polar filament is isofilar, possessing 6 coils in one row. The following features distinguish the genus Pankovaia from other monokaryotic genera of Tuzetiidae: (a) exospore is composed of multiple irregularly laid tubules with a lengthwise opening, referred to as “semitubules”; (b) episporontal space of sporophorous vesicle (SPV) is devoid of secretory formations; (c) SPV envelope is represented by a thin fragile membrane.",Pankovaia semitubulata,oval; ovocylindrical,"['oval', 'ovocylindrical']","{'oval', 'ovocylindrical'}",

"ltrastructure, development, and host–parasite relationship of a new species of the genus Pleistophora—a microsporidian parasite of the marine fish Epinephelus chlorostignei. The life cycle of a new microsporidian of the genus Pleistophora is described. This parasite infects the epithelial cells of the gut and the peritoneal cavity of the Red Sea fish, Epinephelus chlorostignei. All stages develop within a special structure, the sporophorocyst, which is covered by a thick dense wall. This wall grows along with the growth of the parasites inside. Meronts are uni- to binucleate, which divide and constantly give rise to sporonts. During transition to sporonts, the cell border of the meronts increases its thickness, temporarily featuring thick irregular projections. Eventually, a uniform thick sporont wall is formed; then, the sporont cells detach themselves from the wall (future wall of the sporophorous vesicle, SPV) and start a series of divisions to produce sporoblasts. The SPV wall is compact, has no pores, and consists of two layers. Mature spores measure about 2.0 × 1.8 µm. They possess a polar filament with 20–28 coils, a posterior vacuole, and a polaroplast made up of an outer part of dense and closely spaced lamellae encircling an inner part of widely spaced lamellae.
